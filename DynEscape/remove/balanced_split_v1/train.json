In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. To you know the first thing about the topic? The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegation in standard english means allegation about the Roman Catholic Church.

Okay, so let's just review this cinematic masterpiece. A man so ugly he hides his face knocks on my door. I, in my true altruistic fashion, invite the fugly little bastard in. I ask how his pathetic day has gone, as if I care. The details are so painfully boring that the whole scene is edited out and suddenly we're in a bar. The way it's worded, he's slightly intoxicated when he drops the roofies in my drink. Considering I don't drink and his dumb drunk ass can probably barely string a full sentence together, I'm obviously not drinking it. All becomes a blur in his God-smitten head, I just play along. The writer was apparently too imaginative to layout the scene for the rape, so we're anywhere from a dark alley to his cockroaches infested digs. He'll go with the alley. I struggle to get away, using my face only, apparently. I mean, that's normal, right? Tea. To, that doesn't work. Shocked. When he tears my clothes off; some time passes, during which I can only assume he's waiting for the Viagra to kick in; then he drops his own clothes and insects his bare erect PENIS into my rectum (damn near killed 'em), without publication. I can only assume penis is in all CAPS as a form of overcompensation; noted. I struggle for a moment, but eventually concede. Probably because I've realized I can barely feel it, so I might as well wait it out. maybe try to push out some poor for ships and giggler. yea, that was a put. Anyway, so he gets off and that's it. That a lame ending. I mean, srsly. It's literally the latest sat rape worn ever, ltrly. and anyone who knows me knows I've read watched a lot of sat rape worn.  ''''''''''''",

That you have to realize is that the words aren't really linked to each other. White trash means someone is white, and they are trash. Black trash would mean someone was black, and trash. I can understand objections to something ridiculous, like n****r trash, but that's only because the descriptive word is racism. White is not racism. Black is not racism. White trash is not racism. Racism implies superiority of one race over another. I surely don't think white trash implies all whites are trash. It'd be like if Chinese jerk were a term - no, it does not imply Chinese people are jerks, just that the particular person it is directed at is Chinese, and a jerk. Secondly, does it matter to the article? Is there a section saying it's racism, or do you want to add one? Of the first, I'd say let it go, and if the latter, I disagree on the basis of the above points. Must wanted to throw in my two cents. Thanks! - 01:08, 13 March 2011",

Will that teacher that you hate, spray 25 kiss You'd be famous just like me if you did what I did His is the anatomy of a school shooting [Verse 2] I see dead people, it isn't my fault that they were evil Luck a favorite I hate everybody equal Pitch I warned y'all, didn't I? Now everybody anna talk shit and cry asking why - Two weeks picked up guns and turned murderous All of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live Two needy kiss is that a crime? why I've gutta be one of the cool kiss just to walk by - without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked Insulting me for no reason, I was treated like shit The teachers let it happen I've even seen some of them teachers laughing That's why I had a smile on my face when I started blastin I wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick I was the nicest person in the world - y'all were docks On't even try to analyze me now you have no chance, back then - maybe you could've been my friend [Chorus]",

    "comment_text": "* The sea-borne trade of the Ottoman Empire was predominantly in Greek hands: there were many Armenian, Turkish, Arab and Jewish merchants, but they kept to the land. In the late eighteenth century trade substantially increased, and Greek seafarers did well out of it. In the Aegean islands, especially Hydra and His, bigger and more modern ships were built, and shipbuilding and trading families made substantial fortunes. It is important to note that the Greek population was widely and thinly distributed within the Ottoman Empire, and that there were also Greek communities in foreign cities. In the peninsula and the Aegean islands the population was compactly Greek, though considerable numbers of Turks dwelt among them in some of the towns. Greeks formed large urban minorities in Constantinople, Alexandria, Bucharest, Nasi the ports of the lower Danube, and in the coastal cities of Asia Minor both in the Aegean and the Black Sea. There were also many Greek villages in the interior of Asia Minor. Outside the Ottoman Empire, the lonian islands had a mainly Greek population. They belonged to the republic of Venice until 1797.  were then occupied in turn by French, Russians and British, and came into British possession by the Vienna peace settlement, Further a field, there were Greek merchant communities in Trieste, Venice, Vienna, Amsterdam and other West European cities. During the eighteenth century European education and ideas made themselves felt among a considerable part of the Greek people The Phanariot princes of Moldavia and Wallachia supported some excellent schools and collected libraries of European books. Knowledge of French was quite widespread at their courts. Constantinople also had good schools, and foreign languages were spoken and foreign literature read. Healthy islands founded schools from their trade and profits. Under Venetian rule the Ionian Islands offered Greeks the chance of education and access to Italian culture. Small but growing numbers of Greeks from the Ottoman Empire studied abroad, especially at Padua but also at Vienna, Leipzig and other German universities. Greek colonies in Western Europe helped the education of their compatriots both by inviting individuals to study in the West and by sending money to found and support schools on ottoman territory. Increasing contact with the West introduced the ideas of the European Enlightenment to Greeks. His process was encouraged by many of the Phanariot rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia, but was disapproved by the patriarchate, although individual priests and even bishops favoured it. Natural science and nationalism were felt as a threat to Orthodox piety. Especially important was the cult of ancient Greece in European Enlightenment literature. Classical learning and thought were praised by the philosophers of the West as older than, and superior to. Christianity. Greeks in the West learned through this literature about their own past, which, if not entirely ignored, had at least been very little known to the intellectual elite of Constantinople either in the last period of the Byzantine empire or under Ottoman rule. The presentation to the educated Greek public of ancient Hellas, as seen through the eyes of French encyclopaedists and sentimental Western philhellenes, was above all the work of Adamantios Korais (174. 8-1833). A native of Smyrna, who had spent six years in Amsterdam and six in Montpellier, and from 1788 until the end of his long life lived in Paris, Korais was an indefatigable author of translations, original works, articles and letters. He devoted himself to the propagation of the Enlightenment among the Greeks and of the Greek cause among the French, and above all to the development of a literary Modern Greek Language, to be formed by the infusion of classical words into the spoken tongue and by the systematisation of its formal structure. Korais took care not to attack religion or the Orthodox Church as such, but he fought bitterly against all customs, institutions and ideas which seemed to him to be superstitious survival from an age of darkness, preventing a return to a glorious past which would also embody in itself all the wisdom of new enlightened Europe. The Orthodox hierarchy disliked this mixture of classic and nationalism, They too were becoming impatient of Ottoman rule as they saw it declining, they too were becoming affected by a new pride in being Greeks. But if the Ottoman empire were to be destroyed (and this did not seem imminent, nor did it seem wise to take big risks on so distant a prospect), they hoped that it would be replaced by something like the old Byzantine empire, based on autocracy and Ortho",

First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edit. The followed every single edit and delete EVERYTHING. The is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me. The has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have improved her already with facts. The has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. The edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's webster, which is also a commercial webster, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay. Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his faces. I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is dealing me on her page, you did not see this? The claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edit are telling a different story. Next the Name of the Rose. The followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was 'Forge's Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry ak Delicious Carbuncle ak 'Restawhile' followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendant in the biggest exhibition fraud in history. )I am pointing out the facts here. The is having a speedy deletions felt and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. The is not. The cannot turn 100% costume fabrication into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blows to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud. Now you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just 'coincidence' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly wandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies. Now I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to fraud the paying public with some foolish fabrication. Delicious Carbuncle's edit which is a message to Ernest W.  Cunningham and Jennifer J.  Dickinson. You be the judge if this is just 'coincidence. 'Please be fair and also block Delicious Carbuncle from further edit. You, Blueboy96 state this one: 'True or not, attempting to out another user is beyond unacceptable. Indefblocked.

His edit was posted on Delicious Carbuncle's site and once she realized that she gave herself away, she edited over it, yet I saved it on time. You have to know that I called up Mrs.  Pauline Berry in order to ask her to stop talking me and to stop supporting one fraud after another. The is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe limitations from time to time. The asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% faces. The did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a 'self proclaimed expert,' she has spent years now on her hateful posting, webster filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation email and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglaries me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people. Please read the edit of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message. The is referring to my calls to her home, when I attempted to find out why she is supporting criminals.

Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a Colgate-Palmolive sundry product) are unrelated. Of it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine. I just wondered. I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyed#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears. In introspect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future. The political question has to do with this military term. Now do depoliticize the article I'm about to create. It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your fresh start?

Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a confluent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contents like you yourself created? A further point: I really like the term fresh start not as much as rest. An you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activist in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics). His would leave something like your fresh start in the primary position. Final question: When I noticed your sub-heading, my first-blush plan was to create Fresh start as a re-direct page; but now that I think about it, maybe the perceived political problems with an article about an American military term would be diminished if the article itself were entitled Fresh start with Reset as a re-direct page?

Must to clarify a little, the criterion about self-identification as an indigenous people is actually one that is frequently and explicitly used by the major sources and bodies concerned with indigenous peoples' affairs and status. It was paraphrase a little for the article, but if you examine a few of the most-consulted definitions (such as UN, World Bank, ILO, etc) you will see that it's embedded in many of these formulation, with a deliberate intent. See for example the definition quotes from these organisations, that used to be in the 'definitions' section of this article but now seems to have been split off into Definitions of the term Indigenous. Is such, I think the criterion needs to remain mentioned along with the others that appear in the opening parts. The statement Note that even if all the above criterion are fulfilled, some people may either not consider themselves as indigenous or may not be considered as indigenous by governments, organizations or scholars does not quite mean the same thing. While that statement itself is fine as far as it goes, IMO it's not an adequate replacement. Self-identification and recognition is part of the set of criterion that are often referred to in indigenous rights contents. I can see some rational in the recent splitting out of the former content of the 'definitions' section into that separate article, however at the same time I think that this present indigenous peoples article does need to devote perhaps more space than we usually do to covering definitions and usage of terms terminology. It's an area where there's a lot of general misconception and confusion between the common, adjective and the formal, specific usage of words like indigenous, and even of the concept of indigenous peoples' rights and concerns (a lot of the discourse on this talkpg and others related are along these lines, for eg. ) I think we could probably spare a few more parts to cover the most salient points and prominent definitions, so the detail's not all placed away into a different article.

Instead, if an article is being worked on bt not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a userspace page: fr example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page caled User:JamesBWatson Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready. I give up quite a signifiant amount of my time to Wkipedia adinistration. Unfortunately a large proportion of wat is posted hre is vanalia, trivial, propagnda, uniformed adlescent speculation, illegl content, and oher helpful stuff. Of there weren't people willing to pt tme into cleaing up te mess, Wikipdia would soon degeerate ino something very different fom the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. Yu are, of course, welcome to criticise any Wkipedia policy, and also to express rational disagreement wth any particular decision I take in the course of the work I do to hlp implement thse policies, but I disagre with yor characterisation of my administative work as rolling. I hpe these commets will be helpful to yu. Of yu have any further questions about these mtters, please feel welcome to contact me here again. However, I have no intention of getting involved in phone calls about Wikpedia work, especially not calls from oe continent to another.",

But the USSR usage of Azerbaijani was not clear. The ethnonym Azerbaijani though is very recently and dates back to the early 20th or late 19th century. In some sources, Azerbaijani is used to refef to any modern inhabitant of the republic while Azeri is the ethnic term meaning Azeri-Turk Is noted by Oliver Boy:“The concept of Azeri identity barely appears at all before 1920. Up until that point Azerbaijan had been a purely geographical area. Before 1924, the Russians called Azeri Tatars Turk or Muslims. (Boy, Oliver. “The new Central Asia: The Creation of Nations”).

I've noticed the same issue too when viewing that page with IE. I honestly don't know how to fix it. Taking the maps really isn't hard. I screen-cap the appropriate section from Open Street Map, then put the overlay in in Photoshop and save it as a PNG. I also have some suggestions for one of your Syracuse articles: Hall of Languages, Syracuse University, a building I have very fond memories of since it (at least then; I think it still does) house the English department (as well as religion, philosophy and (I think) political science) and I spent a lot of time in its classroom and offices. You definitely want to get a picture of its interior, since it was completely gutted in the early '80s and rebuilt. It now has a very contemporary interior with a sort of planted trim that goes up two or three stories from the front . you'd see it almost immediately upon entry. His would have happened after it was listed, so you'll need some other source. Also, I don't know if the nomination said this or not, but I'm not entirely sure it's the earliest of building (it certainly is the oldest extant one). I always thought it was slightly prepared by Winchell Hall, a small brick building across the street that was demolished in the early 1980s to make way for the Schine Student Center.

I have no idea wat CNN will do though I have a strong feeling that tey woud LIKE to supprt Lamnt. Personally, I cn't stand anti-war candidates in this era because most of them don't want to use te military of AL. Tat being said, I'm not blndly pro-war, either. I want to use fore when it's neccessary. I suppored the reasons fr the war in Iaq (and still do) bt I'm totally pased off about how Buh hs waged te war. It's as if Bush wnts to lose or pass te problem to the next president. (Talk)",

With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitar, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first domo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation. Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7 Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal tormented. Is the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mind cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mind cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal rising with teno and industrial parts, splatter moves - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene. Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Do - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-path soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut of named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. In inhuman voice and a blasting rising made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground. In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split of with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new network. After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Rigidity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Amiable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy.

    "comment_text": " Answer from Falun Gong talk page Katsam, Am a Falun Gong practitioner, if youd like to listen to what i have to say, i can answer your questions briefly from our point of view. Any people see Falun Gong in different ways, some criticize it and some other people practice it, youll hear many things from many people but in the end its up to you to make up your mind about it. Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind and body, there are the 5 sets of excercises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Or. Li. The purpose of our practice is to assimilate to the principles of Truth Benevolence Forbearance and letting go of attatchments, all this is substantiate by the practice of the excercises which provides you with gong, gradually clean your body and evolved many things for you. A religion can be a cultivation system but not necessarily a cultivation system has to be a religion, so Falun Gong is in no way a religion of some sort, we dont pray or worship any gods at all and there are no churches or enrollment sistems, people practice voluntarily and you can start or stop whenever you want. You can practice wherever and whenever you want and as long as you want, There are practice sites where you can go if youd like to share your practice and time with other practitioner too. There are no ranks in falun gong, there is an assistant who reaches the excercises to new people and coordinate the group practice. Or. Li is often reffered to as the master by the students because of respect but he never asked to be called this way. According to our point of view, to be practitioner is to be a person who wants to be better everyday and who wants to improve himself in all the aspects of his life but as you may have noticed, not everyone is perfect and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation, everyone has their own attatchments and personal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved, so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other types of Qigong. About the persecution, our point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioner in China that the government decided to supress them in order to prevent that the Chinese people would start following principles different from the Chinese Communist ideology. Expression or persecution, however its called, something is happening. Some other people may deny it, the government might say there is nothing going on but we believe its very clear that there is something going on. You can identify the practitioner at the practice sites while they do the excercises or you can just ask, true FG practitioner dont lie, if they dont want to say something, perhaps they wont say it, but whatever they say must be true, thats the way it should be. But i wonder now, how can you supress this practice by just telling people not to do it? we think there is something beyond that, which is torture. Of you want to legally forbid something, you have to have a reason for it, so if you dont have it, you come up with it. Everything i just said is the FG practitioner point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opinion of everyone present on this talk page, perhaps later on you might listen to the critics point of view, again all i can say is that its up to you to make up your mind about it. Of youd like to see some pictures or know more about the practice from the practitioner point of view, you can go to this webpage www. falundafa. com",

    "pert_comment_text": " Answer from Falun Gong talk pae Katsam, Am a Faun Gong practitioner, if youd like to listen to what i have to sy, i can answer yor questions briefly from our pint of view. Ay people se Falun Gog in different was, some criticize it and some other people pracice it, youll hear may things from mny people but in the end is up to yu to mae up yor mind about it. Falun Gog or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind ad body, there are the 5 ses of excrcises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Or. Li. The purpose of our practice is to assimilae to the principles of Truth Beevolence Forbearance ad leting go of attatchments, al this is substantiate by the practice of the excercises whih provides yu wih gog, gradally clean yur body and evolved many things for yu. A religon can be a cultivatin sstem bt not necessarily a cltivation sysem has to be a religion, so Falun Gong is in no wy a religion of soe sort, we dnt pray or worship ay gods at all and there are no churches or enrllment sistems, people practice voluntarily and yu can start or sop whenever yu wnt. Yu can practice wherever and whenever yu want and as long as yu wnt, Tere are practice sites where yu can go if youd like to share yur practice and tie wih oter practitioner to. There are no ranks in falun gong, there is an assistant who reaches the excercises to nw people ad coordinate the group practice. Or. Li is often reffered to as the master by te students because of respect but he never asked to be called tis way. According to or point of view, to be practitioner is to be a person who wnts to be better everyday ad who wants to imrove himself in all the aspects of his lfe but as yu may have noticed, not evryone is perfet and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation, everyone has their own attachments and peronal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved, so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other tyes of Qgong. Abut the persecution, or point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioner in Chia that te government decided to supress them in order to preent tat te Cinese people wold start following principes different from the Cinese Commnist ideology. Expression or perecution, howver its called, smething is hapening. Some other people may deny it, the government might sy there is nothing going on but we beieve its very cear that there is something going on. Yu can identify the practitoner at the practice sites while they do the excercises or yu cn just ask, true FG practitioner dont le, if they dont wnt to say something, perhaps they wont say it, but whateer they say must be true, thats the way it should be. But i wonder now, how can yu supress this practie by just tellng people not to do it? we think there is something beyond that, wich is toture. Of yu wat to leally forbid something, yu have to have a reaon for it, so if yu dont hae it, yu come up with it. Evrything i just sid is te FG practitioner point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opiion of everyone presnt on this talk page, perhaps later on yu might listn to the criics point of view, again al i can sy is that its up to yu to mke up yor mnd about it. Of youd like to se some pictres or know more aout the practice from the practitioner point of view, yu can go to this webpage www. falundafa. com",

The text does not mention Charlton but I have not watched or listened to the video, so I don't know if he's mentioned. He that as it may, IMO this was not a serious fixture and should not be added to the infobox. Any thoughts? Derek Stillie has had this into added too Should be treated like any other nation not recognized by FIFA. Of those are included, this should be too, as the NF-Board, who seems to be the next official thing, recognized this match. - Apparently Mr Charlton captain the side. In my opinion, any governing body that accepts membership from an attention-seeker representing a fort in the sea with a resident population of 3 whose football association advertised for members of the public worldwideto write in and apply to be a second-half substitute in a supposed international match under said governing body's control, loses any possible credibility. I hope the ground where the match was played made a few quid behind the bar, but of has it correct, it's not a serious fixture and shouldn't be in the infobox. A sentence in the prose is fine, but that's all. cheers, It was an official NF-Board recognised match. I don't know what that means in terms of nobility but looking at players of other NFB national tears, there's about a 50-50 split to whether their caps are mentioned in the infobox. Dom Regardless of what we normally do with NF-Board countries, I don't have a problem in removing Sealand from the infobox as aspecial case. He are after all talking about a country with no grass or artificial turf, and a population of fewer than 11 people. —WFC—",

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Were is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censor at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (! ! ) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article. Is you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. His quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contracted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily veritable by people at Wikipedia. Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly! Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematical sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fantastic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. Of I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens. And I will answer the points you raised in your previous posting, Mütze. So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (! who are the only ones who complained about my article so far. But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia! Were is what Limbo Wales says on his user page:Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elite, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers. Of he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. That I say above, he call it one of his main principles! So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true canals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia! Limbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively! So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematical.

To once a theoreticians has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformation apply, things can be taken from there. Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted. Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? Of gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. His is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relatively. Something has to give. His theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scala theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relatively, and a successor to special relatively is needed. (And was provided by Einstein. ) Poincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitation-inertia mass equivalent as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertia mass. When light propagated from an emitted to a receiver, it not only transmit momentum, it also transmit inertia mass. The inertia mass of the emitted decreases on emission of the light, and the inertia mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertia mass to energy. In his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the elections. An that still work for means and tauon's? By understanding is that elections and means are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should elections and means become more and more alike at higher felicities? To my knowledge: at all felicities the energy of means is the mon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor. I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. Is you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relatively. | Talk",

He was quick to remove the tag added by you, and made the section which was delete by you with Barrister Sultan Mahmood. Now he is asking in the discussion area for permission to add deepika and adil there. In order to add he brought a proof from a forum where it should not be difficult to ask for such post. Right after the post appeared there, Atwozee was quick to use that as a reference. Of it would have been an earlier post, then one can conclude that the post was correct and Atwozee just found it now, but if, right after the post came on that forum, he knew that.

He made someone to write a similiar post on another site also. I hope you would calm him down. as far it goes for adding Adil khan and deeyah, it should be better to ask his father or mother , if they belong to this group. if you like I can arrange their email address.

Bloody Bastard, son of bitch. Lolz! I am sure this was written by Atwozee. he wrote first reply while remaining unlogged with this ip Thathaal sir name is used by only thathaals on this planet, and few Thathaals use this sir name, Thathaals Rajputs use the title Raja while Thathaal Jats use the title of Chaudhry. To Admin it's for your information that Adil Thathaal And Deepika Thathaal are real Thathaals so list them here under the heading of notable Thathaals. When he wrote those filthy words about me while still unlogged. When he longed and wrote  Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry is a thathaal Jat but he never used the title of Thathaal at the end of his name he used the word Chaudhry. Which is the real title of Jats and even every caste of Jats use this title. then he gave that link and unlogged and came back and wrote while still remaining unlogged ip  Admin must fix Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry under the heading of Prominent or Notable Thathaal. Atwozee has gone mad because he thinks this page is his personal property. And he is feeling threatned that this might change. I am fully capable to use the same filthy language while remaining unlogged as well, but since you told me to be careful with the language, so I am doing as you said. I would need your advice and an apprpriate response as far it goes for Atwozee. Regards",

To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing style and layout. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page situations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare. The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. Now one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpired - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructive criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response.

It is a matter of an apparent breach of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me.

I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remote similar. I was then told by a third party that Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project and that Sven had said well, I'm going ahead with it. Manguard has since said on my talk page, you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen . Actually, the bartering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been appraised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has diverged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicates without attributing. Of distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implements without attributing to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. His is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making legal threats; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything legal? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practically. I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be directors at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly marched into accusations of gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks. I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—not mature enough—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. To one has mentioned those. His seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues.

One thing that did seriously concern me and that I'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that Casito's statement about webster detachment being a crime in many jurisdiction is absolutely 100% misleading in our context. First, there are no local jurisdiction issues here, the Internet is regulated at the national level in the U. S.  (I'm sure you knew that). Second, like I told Casito, this is a Wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of detachment, which certains more to secure static webster (think US Govt homepages for instance). I don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what Casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will. Of course he didn't realise that I could see through his bluff, and when I calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite pissy, just as I'm sure he would in real life. Must between you and me, he just doesn't seem like a really cool kid. For you, however, I have the utmost respect, being a liberal arts Professor in the only civilised part of the U.

Why it wasn't a personal attack The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm. (From WP:of). Of the list of reasons, on WP:of the only one plausible applicable is Disruption. Under this it has A user may be blocked when his her conduct severely disrupt the project — his her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegiate atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmonious to create an encyclopedia. And Blocks for general incivility are controversial. In no way could any of my actions be considered severely disruption. Or even simply disruption. While it could be argued that my signature was generally civil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first. To, from WP:of there is no reason (in my opinion) to block. Now we examine WP:NPA. His is simply, To not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia and I agree with it. The point here is personal. By signature was not a personal attack on anyone. It was a generalised comment and an in joke (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke). For the attack to be personal, you would need to find someone who was attacked, you would not be able to do this. To, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edit, thus it should not be a factor in anything. Is to general incivility, I simply disagree. From WP:CIVIL, Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally target behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress. By signature was not personally target behavior (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of conflict or stress. There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case. Why I should not have been blocked In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:of which states, Established users with significant constructive edit should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual was or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users. In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:of. You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely. In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and or detailing why you felt that the block was needed. That could have happened To, what could you have done? Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example). Of you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature. Of I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and or taken it to a hearing. Conclusion Is I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing. However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so. His, by the way, is simply a statement. That would I like you to do? Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you. Of you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.

Even in a footnotes, his original research that islands in the Fraser River are not actually part of the continuous mainland is fictitious and constitute digging in his heels on his position; I simply corrected his (going) error and mis-use of language; he wants to mention the City of Richmond, not its main island (Lulu Island, which also includes about 1 3 of the City of New Westminster, namely Queensborough), yet his footnotes spoke of Richmond as an island. I'm not the one making the disruption edit. Franamax, who's familiar with the area, also concur about the notion that freshwater islands are obviously part of the mainland and distinct from offshore islands such as Bowen; and that same footnotes also re-digs in the false notion that dictionary definitions have anything to do with the meaning of the name. The RfC accomplished nothing, except the consensus refutation of any validity to his position, and rise my back up over something wildly silly in nature for no good reason; and the RfC closed, with the consensus that JimWae's position was wrong, but a footnotes explaining , not asserting. JimWae simply went ahead and inserted his original problem-content as if it were all pachy keen and he had won. But he didn't even get the English idiot contiguous mainland correct, I corrected that; he also wanted to centre on the City of Richmond even though that's not, in and of itself, an island (it's about 20); I simply pointed out the absurdity of what he had added by adding other things that didn't fit the dictionary definitions attached to lower and mainland. Of you give as license to absurdity, or tolerate it, then you have to tolerate absurdities ensuant on it with impartiality. Rivers and lakes are not land, but they are part of the mainland, mountain peaks are not lower, but they are part of the Power Mainland. To either the RfC stands - with JimWae's assertion being dismissed as original research - or you are enforcing a selective interpretation of it forbidding anyone from altering what JimWae wants to add, even though his addition was not supported by the RfC. *A* footnotes was tolerated by the RfC, or suggested by it. But nobody said let JimWae say whatever he wants so long as it's in footnotes form. And if he uses incorrect language idiot, then anyone (including me) can correct it - the City of Richmond is not an island, and the expression continuous mainland is not the correct English idiot for what he thinks he's saying. It's that simple. You're welcome to reverse the consequent absurdities I've added; but if you do, and leave JimWae's false and original research as it is, then you have gone against the consensus of the RfC. Lulu Island is in the Fraser River, not Georgia Strait, it's that simple; and the river is on the mainland, so what's in it is on the mainland. if that needs to be explained in a footnotes, it doesn't need to be explained in the way that JimWae put it; which was, again, simply his re-operation of his original erroneous and original-research interpretation.",

In the Myth of Male Power, he endorsed the concept of a ‘gender transition movement‘ as an alternative to either a ‘women's movement‘ or ‘men's movement‘. He has maintained this position since the book's publication in 1993, and has continued to promote the notion in every book published since. Additionally, I cannot find a single original, table source to support use of the term masculinist being applied to him. Is such, I have removed references to this non-neutral term. I hope anyone watching this page will agree that I have enhanced the quality of this article tremendous. I am going to remove the request for clean and the neutrality dispute since I don't see any recent, active discussions that will remain addressed with the addition of the careful situations I have added. (previous content:)Warren Farrell (born 1943) is an American masculist author. Farrell holds an M. A.  and a Ph. D.  in Political Science (UCLA; New York University (NYU)). He has taught at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and at Georgetown University, Rutgers, Brooklyn College, and American University. With the publication of The Myth of Male Power, Farrell became one of the first masculists. The term is difficult to precisely define, but in his case masculism is a form of celebrating men as no less than women, and rejecting any exist displayed against men by women. Since the early 1970s, he has been a champion of feminist, serving on the board of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Within a few years, he was asked to leave NOW as his views diverged from those generally held in the organization; most specifically, he was critical of what he saw as female exclusiveness and disregard for men's issues. His early books The Liberated Man and Why Men Are the May They Are were more in the vein of a type of men's liberation–an approach to men's issues similar to that of feminist to women's issues. These texts were not critical of feminist. Farrell's critics declare him to be exist and have an anti-woman attitude (or misogynistic). However, despite his being broadly attacked by many latter-day feminist including Susan Faludi. In answering his critics, Farrell argues that his approach is essentially of equality and humanity. His approach to gender issues has come to be the cornerstone of masculism. His ideology calls for gender equivalent and, unlike some other masculists, a reduction in traditional gender roles. He has made a critical examination of the power balance between the sexes, claiming that in some cases it favors women: The women's movement had done a wonderful job of freeing women from sex roles, but no one did the same for men. Farrell was a candidate for governor in the 2003 California recall election. He came ninety-seventh out of 135 candidates. In May 27, 2005 Farrell appeared on John Stossel's Give Me A Break segment of 20 20 to discuss, in his view, why men earn more. In the report he is seen speaking before the Cato Institute. He asked members of the audience to stand if they worked at least two years at a job meeting certain criterion: jobs which exposed them to wind and rain or long hours, for example. It was almost entirely men who stood. Some suggest that the Cato Institute event had been stage to promote Farrell's books and opinions. Nonetheless, the event served to illustrate one of Farrell's key points - that women tend to choose, and are generally encouraged by the popular press to choose, jobs that are socially fulfilling rather than monetary fulfilling. For instance, men are encouraged to work well-paid, long-hours jobs, whereas women are encouraged to search for jobs that allow them more time with their children or are seen as socially pleasant, involving little physical labour or serious physical unpleasantness. These jobs, across the board, tend to be paid less than the former. In addition, men are more likely to do overcome (and are of course encouraged to do so) than women, so necessarily get paid for more hours worked. See also Masculism",

AFAICR, the Kept of Education essentially said Not our problem when a teacher (? ) complained to them about Folens using the BI term in its atlas and told the complaint to get in touch with the publishers directly. To me, what smack of a post-colonial inferiority complex is the drive by a vocal minority to expunge the term from every Irish-related article. I rarely if ever use the term myself in everyday life (I prefer Ireland and Britain or Britain and Ireland), but if it does get used - meh! Fig deal! I don't think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign Ireland, put us down, offend us, somehow claim our territory or subside us back into the union, the way some people on here seem to take it. Britain and Ireland, though, isn't a geographical term - its two different islands! I'd rather just say the Shannon is the longest river in Ireland than the longest in B & I - though my preference would still be to use the worldwide common name for the island group.

Government polcy doesn't cover geography. And as demonstratd, governmnt policy dosn't apear to cover of senators ad ws (but thn, tat's not new. AFAICR, the Kept of Education essentally said Nt our problem when a teacher (? ) complaind to them aout Folens usig the BI term in its atlas and told the complaint to get in toch with the publishers directly. To me, what smak of a pot-colonial infeiority complex is the drive by a vcal minority to expunge the term frm every Irish-related article. I rarely if ever use te term myself in everydy lfe (I prefer Ireland and Britain or Bitain and Ireland), bt if it does get used - mh! Fig deal! I don't think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign Irland, pt us don, offend us, somehow clim our territory or subside us back into the union, te way soe people on here seem to take it. Britain ad Ireland, though, in't a geographical term - is two different islands! I'd rather just say the Shannon is the logest river in Ireland than the longest in B & I - though my preference would still be to use te worlwide common name fr the island group. BaStun not BTsun",

Of you sincerely believe that there are issues with some of the material being presented, please discuss your concerns on the talk page, and try to find an acceptable way forward. Note, however, that WP exists to make accessible material that has been published in what it considers to be reliable sources. Of the material appears significant and relevant to the article, and has been published in a legitimate academic journal, normally one would expect to find it included in the article. Even if the material is questionable, if it is in wide circulation and often presented in discussions of the topic, then on those grounds alone it should still be included. Of there are good grounds for questioning the material, those grounds can be discussed in the article but note that they must reflect the position of reliable sources that have been published and can be reference, not just your own personal beliefs, knowledge, or published research. (See WP:NOR for more information). Sorry if this seems heavy-handed, but in 10 years evolution of Wikipedia these principles have proved to be a key foundation for building stable and improving articles that everybody can contribute to.

Courtesy banking is better in such cases. g It's only four talk pages. There's absolutely no need for crazy statements like Your deletions is improper. He can get to the bottom of why the Mercury left and why he requested deletions, and deal with undeletion and courtesy banking as soon as we know the full reasons behind the request. I've tried to contact Mercury, but for the moment, I've undeleted the pages, courtesy blanket them and protected them from further edit. I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletions again and cities privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request. (ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletions of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be rapidly invoked. ) Of you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletions oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletions might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide.

There's some delete edit to the article which should be fairly self explanatory regarding the need to delete the article and create a new article, but it looks like the editor responsible has simply given up. Thanks, done. I'll keep a watch and make sure that no one has been lying in wait, which would be a bit strange, since they could have created an account that could have edited the page by now. Cheers, Wikipedia:Requests for adminship Elonka Thank you for your support in my of. It was definitely a dramatic debate! I paid close attention to everything that was said, and, where possible, I will try to incorporate the (constructive) criticism towards being a better administrator. I'm taking things slowly for now, partially because it's the holiday season and there are plenty of off-wiki distractions.  ) I'm also working my way through the Wikipedia:New admin school and double-checking the relevant policies, and will gradually phase into the use of the new tools. By main goals are to help out with various backlogs, but I also fully intend to keep on writing articles, as there are several more that I definitely want to get to of:of status!

Entwistle's familynamely her brother Milton Entwistle and his daughterfurnished me with hundreds of documents including diaries, letters, and telegram. Before I met them I spent 5 years searching her careerliterally reading the era's newspapers and theatrical-related periodicals a page at a time. I spent hundreds of hours doing interviews. I found Entwistle doing radio in 1925, having lunch at the White House in 1931, being black failed, and a dozen other things no onenot even her family had known. And because of her family's cooperation, I was able to complete a timeline that other authors had never before been able to string together. EVERYTHING I discovered has at least two veritable, reliable sources. Wiki editors Rossrs, and Wildhartlivie, and I spent weeks taking the Entwistle articleit wasn't perfect, but it was good enough for them and so it remained good enough for Wikipedia until you came along and decided you knew more about her than her biography.

I would be fine with something similar, The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members.

Furthermore, if we take a clinical look at what they do today, its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi-media (television, internet, etc. ) to training and mortification programs to historical preservation along with sobbing and other political activities. To to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes gun control, gun rights, or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article, hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence.

Maybe something like, The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for forearm related issues and activities. Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military, the organization has gone through several transformation as well as expanded its purpose and goals. In the 21st century, it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D.

When I post to an article about the city of Chicago, I do so as somebody who actually does live here, has done so for a good long time, and knows the place firsthand - something that the idiot who did the revert can't legitimate claim for themselves. You've offered a vague remark about how I have a problem with some of the editor's opinions; in true Sent fashion, giving the spin while leaving out the awkward details. The opinions given are on such subjects as what the lowest reported temperature in Chicago was, whether or not cheese customary appears on an Italian Beef sandwich, and other things which, like these, aren't a matter of guesswork, but of simple observation. One of the additions I made to the article which somebody, I believe yourself, wiped out with a revert mentioned the arctic express winter of 1981-82. When one takes the already silly concept of NPOV, and exaggerated it to the point at which one wiped out mentions of actual historical events which one just doesn't happen to have been will informed enough about the subject to havew heard of, one has reached a level of lunch unusual even by the standards of the Internet and postmodernism. I said this before and will stand by it - anybody who feels that the mention of an unusually cold winter is too much cointroversy for the site to handle obviously has issues that cry out for meditation. To let's not act like I was getting angry because one of the editors (read: overlay push posters) disagreed with me about what the best movie of May was, or anything of that sort, which is clearly the impression that you're trying to leave the reader with. By well-justified anger comes from the fact that somebody has used censorship in an attempt to conceal the fact that he didn't know what he was talking about when he wrote that article. I might say that same about the people who did the revert, including, for example, somebody from Concordia, wherever that is - somewhere far enough from Chicago that most of us have never even heard of it.

I put it to him it was the other way around since AAP was supporting the BJP's demand for CAG audit. The 2010 High Court decision was in the Petition of And Shore Are (a BJP Councillor). Jayant Bhushan was for the intervene (AAP's) Prashant Bhushan in of(C) 4821 2010.

CAG IssueResponseAt present the CAG has no authority to audit the accounts of private companies in view of the clear provisions contained under Article 149 of the Constitution of India. The various provisions of the CAG Act, 1971, clearly set out the duties and powers of the CAG are with respect to audit of accounts of Union States and Government Companies   Corporations. These powers do not extend to private companies. Subsequent to transfer of management control to discoms in 2002, CAG categorically confirmed stating that from July 1, 2002, discoms are not government companies under Section 617 of the companies Act, 1956. DERC itself, in its tariff order of 28. 05. 09, had observed that the private discoms being a company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, presently there is no such provision of CAG audit in respect to private companies.
