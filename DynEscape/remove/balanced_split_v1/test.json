When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy. But I guess I'm wrong. Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs. Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrite. His is making my head spin, and hurt alot. I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever. Putting it under double standard is not putting a WORD to it. For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players. I am a victim of a victim. Is this an example of hypocrisy? Or is it an example of double standard? Of it is a double standard being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior? You are a Hypocrite! apparently does not apply, so, do I say You are applying a Double Standard! Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch. To me Double Standard relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior. Of a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, ak Racism. The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example. A woman can get paternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot. I detect a Double Standard there as well. Of I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite? Of I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite? Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing? Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies? By head hurts too much to keep going. His is all By Humble Opinion, and I am probably quite stupid and an idiot.",

According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me. He did not do that. He also is obliged to provide me with some specific which he did not do. And Final warning suggests a previous warning had been given.

The only thing that others me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think). He also delete my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too. I suspect the batman comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman). But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Right due is demonstrable sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has prove evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh sum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).

Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel Denver, Colorado Fred Bauder, Pro Se Crestone, Colorado PER CURIAM In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for restatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. He accept the recommendation. I.  Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegation of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C. R. C. P.  241. 13(b); People v.  Paulson , 930 P. 2d 582, 582 (Colo.  1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. In July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for restitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v.  Bauder , 941 P. 2d 282, 283 (Colo.  1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058. 97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. Is a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowing disobey an order of this court in violation of Colo.  RPC 3. 4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo.  RPC 8. 4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C. R. C. P.  241. 6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). of. The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for restatement, and as a further condition of restatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Up. 1992) (ABA Standards ), [s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowing violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding. ABA Standards 6. 22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer (a) intentionally or knowing violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession. D.  at 8. 1(a). The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. at 9. 22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. 22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. 22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. 22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. The lawyer respondent has default and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. He elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v.  Wished , 956 P. 2d 542, 544 (Colo.  1998). He are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo restatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. III. It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for",

To really my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn! ). Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guideline that govern our content. I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place. Being an encyclopedia that anyone can edit means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guideline (PAG) to help provide a body of law as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion. Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west - a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room crawl. But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it. One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is.

In the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. The Wikipedia guideline on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluation sources. The guideline on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge. The guideline, consistent with the general Wikipedia guideline on reliable sources, remind us that all Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources (emphasis in original). They helpful define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or document their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarize one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guideline let us know that Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves. Two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetic are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human DNA, including DNA from ancient individuals. Earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples (fewer genet, and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times). Is more samples of more genet from more individuals from more places and times are gathered, the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the Earth's surface and mixing genet over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human holland in Africa.

You've made three mistakes: Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? In the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i. e.  until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable? Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensus? Returning the chapter, or removing it? The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. Of you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page. Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for of:3RR and edit-warring - if I continue to revert, also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for of:3RR and edit-warring - if you continue to revert. Of you continue to both - remove a consensus chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensus chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.

Is thirteen inches long enough? It makes guns quite distraught. They week across in rivals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can see. Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Kuz it really can relieve. Without this fabulous organ, To shag would be complete. Hessians will try their best; But must admit defeat. It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course daily to peeBut I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute.

Now would updated sources distance themselves from war propaganda? ::* In the article and on this talk page, the convoy battle of MW10 (3 21 - 3 26 1942) is inflated with the Second Battle of Sirte (3 22 1942).

Further, Bragadin and Footman seem to use fatal in a limited sense: Bragadin to refer to the March 23 Axis air attacks that sank Clan Campbell and contributed to the sinking of Southwold (166) and Footman to refer to just the latter (308). More to the point, though, which reliable published sources credit the Italian fleet's intervention with having had any but the most indirect effect on the fate of the remaining three ships of the convoy? Also, how is it just a 'research' if no primary or secondary sources state the Italians won a marginal victory? In a related topic, the U-Boat analogy seems strained since the circumstances bear little resemblance to those at issue here. Moreover, the analogy seems to assume (without proof) that some other sources are based in favor of the allies point of view, and therefore editors should not be compelled to cite only the allies version of the facts. But, how is this position consistent with verifiability? In another tack, if reliable published sources expressed no opinion about who won the Second Battle of Sirte or if sources were divided about who won, the article could simply reflect that non-opinion or divided opinion. However, in this case, six reliable published sources state the British won, while none (as yet) affirm a marginal Italian victory. ::* The full Macintyre quote also includes this: Vian had gained a tactical and moral triumph.
