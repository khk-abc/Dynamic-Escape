But I don't mind the insulting language. That I do mind is that you either have not read what I wrote, or refuse to respond. I explained why BCE CE are most definitely not insulting to Christians or Christianity, and I explained to whom the Common Era is common. Now let me ask you a question: when you say christendom, what do you mean? of you mean the world consisting only of all Christians? Of so, you are wrong, because many non Christians agree by convention to call this year 2005. Or by christendom do you mean all people who use the Gregorian calendar? Of this is what you mean, you are really insulting me and violating NPOV. I am not a Christian and although I call this year 2005 it insults me, and it is inaccurate, to call me a member of Christendom. Of you believe that Christendom — the rule of Christianity – should rule Wikipeida, you have no business here at all. Now dare you exclude all non-Christians (or demand that non-Christians accept Christian practices)? That does Common Era mean? It means an an era common to many people of many faith, including Christianity but yes believe it or not including non-Christians too, and refusing to privilege a Christian POV.

I am a serving officer in the Met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and relit of borough constabularies such as the WPP. Of serving front line police officers are ensure, then I have to say there is a definite grey area for the public. I have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent. Is a result, I and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflect reality. Is it was, the article was subjective and questionable. However these edit have been reverted without explanation – apart from comments such as ‘this is the truth’. In effort to explain my edit and prevent an edit war I set out below my reason for altering the article. London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967. His act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parts bye-laws in their respective parts. It does not make these constables ‘police constables’ and does not allow police services or forces to be established. To police powers are given to these parts constables (with the exception of parts bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‘any person’ powers or as in the case of arrest, ‘citizen’s arrest’. In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables. BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003. Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986. I could go on…By point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services forces. The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed. To the article started by saying, “Wandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run…”. Two points about the opening sentence. Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parts constabulary. Secondly, the comment regarding ‘successfully run’ is highly subjective and without basis. All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any situation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article. Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it. Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective. Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parts constabulary. His paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables. The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‘police constables’ but as ‘parts constables’ due to the legislation involved. Once sworn in the parts constables have executive powers to enforce parts bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY. Criminal law is not included. However, just like the general public, parts constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only. His is commonly known as ‘citizens arrest’. Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parts constables need to be aware of the necessity criterion to make an arrest lawful. By point is that the article read like the parts constables had police powers – they don’t (apart from the bye law aspect). The paragraph then goes on to state that parts constables come under PACE. Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP). That it doesn’t do is give parts constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect). For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (“They are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws. ”) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading. There is no such thing as a parts ‘police officer’. I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parts constabularies and their use of the word ‘police’, blue lights and use of baton etc. These were delete without reason. They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area. You may not agree with the report and committee’s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there of a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion. NEWLI",

The recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluation its sources.

After having done this evaluation, I have come to the conclusion that the article weaknesses referred to by the IP editor appear to be substantiate.

I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a genetic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project. Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that. One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Tender to May; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i. e.  issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other. For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but I think different people have lastly different ways of telling the story that connect these people and their claims. I'd hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another. I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganized and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views. I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution. of",

I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from sciece as a genetic actvity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project. Second, although thee hs ben progress in science in tat there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that. One way to deal with this (if others find my critiisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientifc method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bcon to Comte to Poper; frm Aristote to Darwin to Tendr to May; from Aristotle to Newton to Eintein and Planck; etc, on te one hand, and varius discussions over how to study ad conceive of the history of science (i. e.  isues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other. For example, I think everyone agres tat Aristotle, Newton, Einsein and Planck are real people wo lived at different periods of time and mae different clams about the world bt I tink different people have latly different ways of tellng the story that connet thee people and their claims. I'd hpe a good article on te history of science would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement fom one period in science to another. I am no expert on this bt I really hpe smeone who feels very confident of their gasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latur, could reorganized ad develop this article in a way that taes teir claims abut science seriously, as well as the claims of those wth opposing views. I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution. of",

On't feel too badly; lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article.
