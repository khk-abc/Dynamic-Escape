Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that fuck is not slang, or your linking to dictionary. com as proof that it is not. The word fuck, while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary. com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what fuck can mean. Is for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning fuck (or fucking) and the euphemism sleeping together lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. Is you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. Of of:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse other sexual activity. such as fuck and sleeping together (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and fuck is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word fuck when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why fuck isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that fuck is also U. S. -central; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term. they are usually using it as profundity. That is also why I told you The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse. I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include fuck. But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.",

    "comment_text": " Attempt at close of old RfC That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, RfC: Does the article minimize the neutrality of India to the notion of caste? That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. That I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholar sources note the neutrality of Hindu India to the very concept of caste. Scholarly and especially less scholar discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside of Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the broader sense signalled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for social ratification and such. I note also that the application of the term caste to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism. Considering those two points, I conclude that it is The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from of and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word caste in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. Is it turns out, there are sources comparing their aggregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste. Allow me a few observations and suggestions. Caste should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India. Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedia article. I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradise to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delicate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cities Balkin in the RfC (social ratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste . caste is at best an effective hyperbole) and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here. Pouring should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan, with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. His is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing hey it's in the paper let's add it needs to be held in check. In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc. ; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantities suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sense some resistance at perhaps borrowing material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go.

    "comment_text": ", 14 April 2012 (UTC)Hi Legolas95, thank you for acknowledging my concern;In etiology section, user:sitush has previously suggested while replying to another user - to restore the previous content excluding Sadasivan's book reference. The concerned sentence from this reference was self-explanatory and was not inclined to any side as to why the term Nayar is derived from Naagar. Please consider the following point also that the Naga point of etiology was not given consideration because of misinterpretation that real serpent have evolved to constitute Hair population - which is entirely false. I was really mentioning this census report shall stand as an authentic reference for the same. By second humble suggestion was to consider the caste system in the article. I would like to invite your attention to the first sentence ie. The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy and in that system outraged even the kings. His sentence at the beginning says about the role of Namboodiri class in Kerala as a whole. His is not about Nairs or the caste system of nairs. Were the proposed sentence gives little light on the scene ie. Nairs observed no internal caste system till the Brahmin migration occurred in Kerala. His is not promotion to nairs but it indirectly says Brahmin migration has influenced Hair caste system. By kind opinion is that it is better to remove present first sentence. Second sentence says,Bulk of them formed the fighting and protecting class, some of whom became chiefs and Naduvazhis. Some sections of the people were engaged in other occupations also. His actually represent all sides of the community. Well me if this sentence seems inclined certainly we shall remove this. The third sentence I consider as little important: It says,It is a notable point that long before Aryans migrated southward, Nairs had travelled far beyond the northern tradition of chathurvarna system and developed a multiplicity of cases. His sentence actually demonstrates that Hair community's social structure is prone to faster development. I have a request to user:Legolas95 user:Titus and user:Qwyrxian - In the reference under consideration, there is a sentence claiming that 'there is no evidence that before 18th century (before 1700 of) the term sudra was ever applied to Nairs. ' Of this like a sentence requires purification, we need to consider references created before this period. That in my mind is that if we be little flexible on the matter of older reference - it can help Hair article. These were my concerns regarding this census report which are quite eligible to be considered and provides some help towards improvement in the article. 19:27",

Twinnings, a wise man, often gave advice to his comrades from the war. He often spoke without wasting words when giving his advice. He was also friendly with nearly everyone, other than those he was on bad terms with. His is perhaps why he had such good connections and the ability to help all of his comrades. • Monteron :A major in the army who served the same time as Richard had. Is Richard and his fellow cavalry men’s superior, Monteron instilled a genuine fear into his subordinates. He emphasized never to leave a comrade when he is in danger, whether it is in the city or on the front lines. Monteron is a youthful, neat, and well behaved individual who tried to carve his men to be the same way. He has a very short temper, particularly in the morning, and the tendency to yell and scream in a way that makes all of his subordinates who have wronged accept their misconduct. He had the respect of all of those under him because of his heart of gold. Instead of gaining pleasure out of reprimanding his men he would become deeply grieved at their failures. His genuine character had left a permanent mark on all of his men. • Lorenz Another one of Richard’s friends from the army, a cavalry man as well. Lorenz was an ideal soldier, well disciplined, responsible, and a firm believer in his ideals. Monteron was quite fond of Lorenz. He had been some sort of a Luddite, constantly preaching of his vision of destroying the machines which have been seen as a source of all evil, and with this destruction would come peace, health, and happiness for mankind. He was constantly mocked by his fellow soldiers for this reason. One day he realized that what he striped for was the impossible, and he leaped out of a window in a barn on the top floor and killed himself. He landed on his feet surprisingly which reflect his ability in gymnastics. • Wittegrewe :Wittegrewe was a former model cavalry man. Wittegrewe was particularly attractive with an excellent singing voice that had all of the women fall for him immediately. He was also a horse riding instructor. He had been one of the best riders to ever live, capable of taking even the most difficult horse within an hour. It was he who had taught Richard how to ride and how to take care of his horses after long rides. Later he had quit the army to get a civilian job as a streetcar driver. Richard was very upset about this, he compared it to seeing a free roaming animal get imprisoned in a cage. Wittegrewe had looked back on his riding days as inferior and unimportant and in his new home had nothing to remind him of horses.

Richard had always been on the f(!]ro·nt li (n]`&e, where Twinnings i&),n the r)`;/ese>~ @r^\"#ves. Twinnings, a wi[@)-se man, often gave advice to his comr%`|^a$(d·+;e);=s from the war. He often spoke without w}asti^n=($g words when giving his advice. He w_as a[×ls(_o friendly with nearly everyone, oth@%/#e- #!r than those he was on b:ad terms with.

H?e has a very short temper, particularly in the morning, and the tendency t(o yell and s*,@cxre=;#am in a way that m(\"&{ake(s all o!->f his subordinates who have wronged accept their misconduct. He had th)@:e respect of all o%}&f those under him b}eca!]×_us,=xe of his hear{×t of gold. Instead of gaining ple^\\as*}<ur*<e out of rep$+/ri,^ma-&#,n×*di;^}ng his men he would become deeply grieved at t(@=hei[·}r failures.

Lorenz was an ideal soldier, w='<>e$@_ll disciplined, responsible, and a firm believer in his ideals. Mont;>=/e·&r&on was quite f ?xo}nd of Lorenz.

He was constantly mocked by his fellow soldiers for this reason. O}ne day he realized that what he striped for was the impossible, and he leaped o$ut of a window in a ba\\%!?rn on the top floor and k}il;*lx}$)ed himself.

Ri~/c$x'~har:.=+d was very upset about this, he c+ *\"o-?'mpa?'r\\&(>ed it to see?.in·<g a free roaming animal get imprisoned in a c{a)<&ge.

    "comment_text": " FAGS It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since granulation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic huge at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undesirable. Having returned to my copy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. When, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another form across the main quand; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend. Is I sat in the decline and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. Is when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an entering strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging required decline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hood earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe. The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since granulation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. Is in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweeter, form-fitting slack, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostrils. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine. It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since granulating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the decline and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa. The intimacy began when we finally went to bed. together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. In arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my naval, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. By eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of discovery due to the lengthy passage of time. To words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life. I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had breed the morning near, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her panama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had been over a year since",

Took, for example, at Korea and the Caribbean Cuba Cuban missile crisis; those are a start on what I think is encyclopedia coverage. Must to say, with no other background, that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Radio network really doesn't give information; I'd recommend waiting for more background and context. There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activist for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker. The article is impossible long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now. Note that I was able to put estimate analysis material in for Korea and Cuba. Such data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual classified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc. , gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial dirty tricks. That's not NPOV. Any sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Leading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers). I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and balanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both proprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.",
