He had been able to find a alone ability and every black football known to man kind is Air Nathan himself. His baseball career involved negative at the beginning, then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racism fan in his early days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football. He went up through Inter Milan youth system, him and balotelli tucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC. There team truly went on to be victorious winning 21 trophies in there first season. Their team is among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up. They have scored 29 goals in the past 4 minutes. Being one of the best footballers was too boring for the great nate, he wanted bigger and better. He became a scientific hair researcher winning the Global peace prize and the biggest half nigga dick.",

I just found the following post from press Dame Ewart on some other user's talk page. Its all very weird. His Gretaw is not me. It seems she also is offended by Dame Sara so good on her. Fancy this Sarah going to anothers talk page and speakign to them as though they are someone else. That is so back. Shows how you guns are. Very delusion. Its a delicious honour to be blocked from you fera ninnys. TY for the compliment. I just edit on Help. com but really, what a waste of time editing anywhere, especially when no one pays for the effort. Ensure Dame Sarah reads this below the obvious delusion it is. To one presume to that extent unless the need some help. Why would I register an accoutn when I wont even sign posts, (too much of nous for that whereas the rest of u dont it seems). User talk:GretawFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search1. Please assume good faith when dealing with other editors. See Wikipedia:Assume good faith for the guideline on this. Longhair\\talk 2. Wikipedia guideline dictate that you assume good faith in dealing with other editors. Please stop being civil to your fellow editors, and assume that they are here to improve Wikipedia. Thank you. Bidgee [edit] GundagaiMs Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edit, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. Of you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such posting is my userpage, not article or project space. Of you truly object to editors middling. and inteferring with some else's words, then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Very time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edit may be edited any number of times by any number of people. It the bottom of each edit page is this statement: Of you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistribute by others, do not submit it. I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemn personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructive and productivity if we refrain from making comments about other users. I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. To thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk)",

Accuracy in this matter lies in reporting how the congressmen & media of the time reference the Russell case.

Should I reference Eire as the Republic of Ireland despite Hoare's understanding of it as 'Eire'? According to your logic that would also make sense. Certainly I can make mistakes, and its fine if Damac chooses to correct inaccurate spelling punctuation to accurate, but I do stick to what I know. That speaks volumes to me that the articles on IRA German intelligence & S-plan have laid untouched by Damac since he signed up. He has only shown interest in them after I corrected his work.",

You will find in allot of countries including the United Kingdom that the word airline is hardly ever used. Any people are not familiar with the term. Of you think its not an necessary edit why feel the name to change? :*Took here, the ones is on you to prove that there is indeed a need to change the name, and most certainly not on me when the previous version was working just fine until you came along. Also, as I've given my explanation in the edit summary whilst reverting you, Airliners is a very specific descriptive term whereas Aircraft is a genetic term. Of you disagree, raise a consensus building dialogue. Thoughts? ::*Listen, before i start, there is no need to take that attitude at all. I havent spoke to your scarasticaly so why do you feel the need? When you say it was fine until i came along, it still makes sense with the word replaced. The word aircraft is a term used more than the word airline outside the USA. His is why i feel the need to use it here. Something to look at, the article in question uses the word aircraft 34 times and the word airline is used twice. *On't play the victim with me here, this edit of yours on my talk page is hardly confidence inspiring when you say that you haven't been sarcastic to me in the first place. Secondly, I reverted you the first time round on the basis of of:AGF and that is being said and done without any prejudice towards you but what about the explanation you gave in the revert edit summary to me the first time round? Seems to everybody here it is a tit-for-tat thing that you're doing, eh? Lastly, go click and read on Airliner and Aircraft, the reason why the former was chosen for that section is pretty much self-explanatory. Lastly, keep all your discussion here and stay off my talk page, you are not welcome because you have no respect for others when you don't read their notes first before you post there. Dieu~! :Is a vanity check, this is an article about an airline, airline seems more appropriate. I find the push to substitute the genetic term aircraft bizarre. Why? ::*WCM, you tell me. *That a wrote on your talk page i stick by. I put that there to ask why i was being ignored. I had a genuine question, you delete it and never got back. Is for the reason for the edit i didn't intend to cause offence. The reason you give was Not Necessary edit so my thinking was if it wasn't necessary surely its not necessary to revert? maybe we just both have different ideas of the definition of necessary?

Of you keep behaving this way, it's just going to escapade. To one is looking to silence you. Editing Wikipedia is a privilege, not a right, like driving a car: you'll keep getting warnings and tickets for bad behavior until your license is lifted. Of you continue to break policy and tell people to fuck off your editing privileges will be revoked. Like real life, it is the way it works. Second, you were told exactly why you were blocked: you violated copyright and harassed the editor who removed the offending material. Did you read of:COPYPASTE like I had suggested? It clearly states that copying text verbatim from other sources into Wikipedia articles is not allowed. It does not distinguish between works of fiction or non-fiction, therefore it holds for all available written content. Even if you don't agree that the edit was a copyright violation, you should not have reacted so hostile. Of you feel people aren't listening to your side, don't call them fascists. It is the same as calling someone a Nazi: it is childish and it will only make people cease to take you seriously.

Of I may say so, it definitely moved the article toward another Features Article nomination. But it is not there yet. By concern lies in the idea that we should avoid including a position, laboring it name-calling. That this does is set up an automatic bias and POV. It also means that we, as editors, are taking a position that it is name calling and it is not actually correct (and I don't know if it is name-calling or correct). And, it means that very positive, positive, and balanced commentary will be allowed, and perhaps some very carefully worded negative commentary. But very negative commentary is then excluded. His means that if a number of the most prominent atheist in the western world (or perhaps world) are united in their strong condemnation, it will not be allowed—in an encyclopedia which is supposed to capture all notable ideas. The following sentence presents a very positive position: Biographers, Mormon and non-Mormon, agree that Smith was one of the most influential, charismatic, and innovative figures in American religious history. It would be unfortunate and very un-encyclopedia if we keep that but exclude a very negative position. In any case, I'm quite satisfied that your edit addressed, in a significant part, the POV issues that exist. I personally would not vote for it to become a features article without including, even in passing, the atheist' position. But that's just me. In any case, thank you again for the addition.

But it's close enough. To let's not get distracted by things that aren't important to the broader discussion. I acknowledge, again, that the Godfray and Turner references say the Moon's annual path is concave. But there are other references that describe it as convex. I see no reason to believe that the Godfray and Turner references are any more reliable on this point than the other references. Terry0051, I'm going to ask you the same questions that I asked Marc Kupper about what your source is for the distinction between convex concave when looking outward from the inside, and convex concave when looking inward at the entire system. But before I ask you all those questions, I'll let Marc respond to the questions I asked him, since he might resolve some of them. -",

For arguement sake lets say a test is done today . Please discuss with me how a test can be done if the dogs that FAIL are not removed from breeding? Why does this test involve gambling? Please also tell me how dogs temperament and or working qualities are NOT inherited from the mothers side? Since only males are fougth. In addition why does one have to test a dog to a dog if the dogs themselves are not working with livestock or will ever see a predator? Please do not repeat here the information you can not prove but is your opinion on the main page.

His has resulted in the lead growing a bit, but this is to be expected, as the body of the article has grown since I originally wrote the lead. I don't think that a lot of your cuts would benefit the lead. For example, you cut most of the first sentence. The fact that horse use in World War I reflected a transitional period in the evolution of armed conflict is a crucial statement that is discussed and fully source in the body of the article. Not only did the use of horses change during World War I, but those changes were a major part of the de-housing of war over the 19th and 20th centuries. Also, I'm not really convinced of the tautologies you claim. Logistics is (to borrow the wiki's definition) the management of the flow of goods, information and other resources, including energy and people, between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet the requirements of consumers. Horses help this management, and therefore by definition they are supporting logistics, i. e.  in logistical support. Also, with the phrase mechanized armed divisions we are trying to emphasize that the non-mechanized, non-armed horse was replaced by divisions that are both. I would ask you to please read the entire article, look at the pouring, and then, only at that point, make comments on whether the article thoroughly and correctly summarize the body. It's really not fair to ask for pouring or changes when you don't know what is trying to be summarized.",

In general, we have tried to use registration as the bar for nobility for political parties. In some cases such as Palmer United, this has been waived - PUP got major, nationwide coverage for months before it was registered, and also had two Queensland state was within its ranks very quickly. Should the new Country Party (which is, I should add, extraordinarily unlikely to achieve registration under its current name) receive that kind of coverage, or get some electors in its ranks, then we might make an exception for it too. In the meantime, this is simply a case of WP:TOOSOON. I know from a long time covering politics here that very many of these kinds of parties fade away quickly without ever doing anything much; I'm not saying that will happen here, but given this party is less than a month old I think it's too soon to be including it. The And issue is useful, and in addition to the ABC does combine to make a claim of serious coverage, one I am not inclined to accept but others might be.

Met me point to the typical as I think mode of tailgaters (I only guess because I am not one) so called autopilot when one switch off and focus only on the stop light of the car in front. His can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. Often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. His is partially unconscious. Our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you. I believe that if they drove not on autopilot, they would long before you decided and changed lane. I believe that such sub un counscious behavior is a result of poor driver training. Proper training enable much better and counsious decisions and faster.",

I'm still quite new and I must admit I haven't got around to scanning new articles yet so I hadn't realised that people might be misled by a title if they didn't know its context. I've made a note to review the categorisation of the micro reference articles as soon as I can find time, but I'll have to ask you to bear with me for a few days as time is short. One thing I can't agree with you about is reading the category to begin with the word list as this would lose the profile of the category. There are already several lists in the privately section and I contend that my work is more than a list. It is built on the Britannica model of A-Z micro references. Any are complete in micro form, as where there is a text addition to the date, currency, etc. summary. Others will have a link to a micro article (e. g. , Abu Dhabi which is finished as a pilot case). But what differentiated the work mostly from other philatelic lists is that it includes numerous axillary references therefrom a link is need to the controlling reference elsewhere (e. g. , stamp issues sometimes use alternate names in their inscription and overprints). But thanks for the advice which is very useful and I will get around to it as soon as I can. I've added it to my 1001 Things To To! All the best.",

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia. By assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend. Of you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrant reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking. It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel. Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point: Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc. , as one could imagine. His was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that. And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc. ), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc. Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio. Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, public interests. Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be document well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article. Met otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else. Met's not do something in such a haphazard way.

By reasoning behind the change was because there is growing mention of common rail diese in the media outlets. The media refers to it as CRD and says things like wave of the future. 55mpg. not a horrid. and so on and so forth. When I searched for CRD I got the disambiguation page and in it was a brief definition of common rail diese but no link to the common rail article. I created a link to the article and went back and studied the other items on the disambiguation. I found that none of the others have good length articles nor have more popularity. To I directed the page to common rail and set a link on top of common rail to the disambiguation.

You have again created damage to my talk page: look carefully at the changes you made in this edit. You managed to add a space in the middle of my signature. That then broke the link to my talk page. I am getting very weary of your incompetent edit which seem to leave a trail of mess behind for other editors to clean up. Is to what you say, here are some replies: * I have shown you the wording which says that we do not include the names of teachers other than head teachers. That means what it says. Please just accept it. *I can see nothing to suggest that I have removed situations from Singaha Bahini Higher Secondary School, Myanglung. Perhaps you tried to add situations and the edit was unsuccessful? Please show me what you are complaining about. *I was confused about the name of the school because you created an article at the title Singaha Bahini Higher Secondary School,Myanglung (another editor then moved it to include the necessary comma before Myanglung), and then in the article you use the spelling Singha. You now say the official registered name is actually (Singha Bahini) not (singaha), so I will move the page to that name. I have now moved it to Singha Bahini Higher Secondary School - we do not need to disambiguate the namme by adding Myanglung because this is the only school of that name Which has an article in English Wikipedia. *You say you have focused to procure the (link) but a Am confused even on this cases so,what kind of links should be added here please? His is not very clear but I think my answer to you is: The note on my talk page asks you to add a link to any article you are discussing on my talk page, because this makes it easier for me, and anyone else looking at the page, to go straight to the page in question rather than having to type its name. I make this request at the top of my user talk page, and you ignore it. It is plain common sense, as a help to anyone reading the talk page. I don't see why this simple request has confused you. Or have I misunderstood your question? Although you obviously have good intentions in editing Wikipedia I am not sure that you are capable of doing so useful. Please take much more care in your edit. Are you perhaps using a touch-screen phone which makes it too easy to add or remove characters without noticing? That might explain some of your damaging edit. Please check very carefully that your edit are correct, and avoid adding or subtracting characters at random as you did to my signature on my talk page. I will patch that up now but I hope not to have to spend more time fixing your careless damage.",

A three-paragraph lead would be way too long for an article of this length. However, you still should try to include some more information there, as it is a bit short. Include a short bit on her appearances and the critical reaction as noted above. Concept and creation section looks good now, well done. Expand or merge the Characterization section into other sections. With it that short, it seems as though you would easily graft it into appearances unless there's more into to be added. You've met GA Criteria 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 easily. The was once the most trusted adviser for the indecisive politician. is unclear. Who are you referring to? (Characterization section)The article seems a bit short (this is my issue with Criteria 3, boldness). You seem to have covered most of the important bases, but there's not a whole lot of information in each. Some of the sections also cover information that would be better places elsewhere (as previously noted, in addition to mentioning Smart's Emmys in Concept and creation, it seems that would be better elsewhere or at least belongs in a subjection). Cry working on how the article is laid out, and as Judgesurreal suggested, definitely use other articles as temples. All in all, it looks pretty good, and would probably either pass or be an easily fixed-up on hold if nominated for GA now. Well done, just consider taking a look at those to guarantee things.

The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, accuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonies under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, civilization game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. To don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now. Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and or are chauvinistic lunatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That truth, or what you guns are shouting here as the common names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness. One big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional.

I've had people that wanted me to use the webster name as the work field, and others that thought it the webster was a publisher. I still believe that the organization that issues the chart in the first place should be treated as the author, and I finally removed that field from the situation because there was a very loud campaign from people that just couldn't understand that corporations can legally be treated as people. Use of italian was another set of arguments, and there was a large segment of people that believed that the chart names themselves were things that we could write to suit our tastes. The work field is the place where I feel the most comfortable making compromises, as it is inherently a desriptive field. I could compromise by changing the work field to read something like Chartverfolgung Simpson,Jessica: Irresistible (album version) at musicline. de, and then treating the piece as entitled, because they really aren't providing a title for the chart pages. Now would that feel to you? —",

    "comment_text": "(r to my favorite editor, started before Spotfixer commented:)Not months, years. He'd been shivering that shit on Shapiro since 2006. Anyway, thanks for the kind words - coming from one in your time and place it's especially touching that you'd be aggrieved over my two week time out from a webster. I often despair of ever getting anything done here. The most basic, obvious, and straightforward applications of policy often take many man-hours, and even a victory never establishes any kind of precedent - the same discredited arguments are just brought to a new forum. Outright deceit goes unpunished; editors say X=100, biting a source that says X=-5, and get away with it. I mean, look at my own block log, for example. The first time I was blocked, it was because a devotedly Jewish and obsessively Zionist admin baited me until he ran out of his 3 revert - he actually put rv#1, rv#2, rv#3. in his edit summarise - then, literally five minutes later, a notorious kamikaze edit warrior with a laser-like focus on Israeli-Palestinian articles shows up to make his first ever edit to the article, I revert him, and then I've crossed the magic 3RR trip wire and I'm blocked. Ffs, even the guy that blocked me - who incidentally was a United States Air Force reserves with a combat record over Afghanistan - ended up scolding Humus Sapiens for his actions. But no sanction, of course - that's reserved for people who say fuck or click undo four times instead of three, not for deranged ethno-nationalists who conspired in secret. Those types get admin bits instead, in honour of all the vandalia they've cleansed from articles about Pokemon. The second time I was blocked, it was because I lost my temper with a semi-literate buffoon, who quoted in boldface huge numbers of Palestinians were also driven out of their homes by their own leaders and or by Arab military forces claiming it supported his text, the vast majority of Palestinians fled of their own accord. He quoted this triumphantly, as if he had convincing refuted my argument and exposed me as a liar. The microcephale in question now appears to be on track to becoming an admin. He'll be in good company. His is not an animal. Must prior to my block, I was working on the lede of our article on the 2008 Gaza war, which for some reason still bears a euphemistic title Israeli-Gazan conflict or some such nonsense. The lede claimed that other Palestinian estimates differ from the Hamas-run Gazan hospital system; the only relevant article cited, a piece in the conservative home team Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, actually noted a very close correlation between Ministry of Health estimates, endorsed by the World Health Organization, independent estimates, and even the Israeli estimate of overall facilities (although IDF insists that the number of combatants was far greater, but only off the record and without specific. ) Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about incivility and personal attacks when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so. I am sick of dealing with this kind of bullshit. That can I say, my patience is not unlimited. I don't mean to make this out as if every editor who has a pro-Israel point of view is some kind of Tetanic monster. I respect Steve sm8900. I respect Avraham. I respect Ceedjee (and I still don't know where he stands except that he's downright mean to anybody who doesn't stand with him! ) Well, I even respect JayJG in my own twisted way, at least he's entertaining, if only in the fashion of a heel. But this endless stream of nonsense wears one down. I genuinely enjoy reasoned debate on talk pages, ok? But when people lie, cheat, assemble, and filibuster, I'm going eventually to blow up. Real with it. (I note with irony my own advice to a newby: Cry and keep your cool, because WP seems to take an extremely hard line against incivility from editors perceived as pro-Palestinian. They will always portray you as a crazy extremist, so it is best to support your arguments with solid mainstream sources. [. . ] You have to be kind of single-minded, I think. On't allow any opportunity for them to turn the discussion away from the real issues. Word your comments carefully so they cannot be twisted into some alternate interpretation to be used against you. Even when you know full well that somebody is lying, just say, I'm afraid I can't understand how you read the source material in that way: it clearly says XYZ. WP doesn'",

Regarding a “fav” or famous fossil list, I think it would become intractable long, not to mention the subjectivity involved. I’ve already noticed that the Lagerstätte page has fallen victim to subjectivity, as several listed sites are not traditionally considered to meet the admittedly fully criterion (i. e. , extraordinary fossil richness or completeness); 100 paleontologists would generate 100 different lists.

I have the page on my watchlist, I forget which number we are up too, either in the late 70s or early 80s on DYKs. Well now, you are better off watching ROH's new show on HDnet. Were is a link to their new show: . That is the best wresting going today. TNA lost all sense of direction. I hope they get back to their old ways, but now they seem like Saw. A cap load of promos and about 20 minutes of wresting. Though last week's episode was very good. TNA are trying to raise the bar with Samoa Joe's new gimmick in which he gets himself red then beat the living hell out of the guy. Last week he hung a guy upside down by his feet and beat him like a pinata with a tendo stick. It was funny and great. Most hate it, since it is controversial, but I loved it. They need to raise the bar. Check it out if you want. They have a few good things going now but at the moment WWE are doing better. Hopefully after the storyline involving The Main Event Mafia and The Front Line in over, they'll go back to their old ways. Sting is supposed to retire this year. Angle might head back to WWE. Of that is the case, then we'll get new blood in the main event. Sometimes I wish TNA would have never got Sting nor Angle, because since then TNA have been watering to them.

I often see people on the Talk page saying it should be changed into an index page with links to the individual episode pages, in the same way as South Park, Stargate SG1 and The Simpsons and I'm sure many others. But I always ignore them because of the immense effort involved in making about 50 new pages. Despite the amount of time I spend on Wikipedia (And I love it, by the way) I still have a degree to study for. His is the first time I've ever gathered to click on the discussion part. Now I see that there's already a page built like the episode lists for most of shows I whole-heartedly agree with the idea of merging the two pages. It looks like I'm too late for the Toll but if I had been there I would have voted to join the two. I imagine there are many many others out there who watch Lost and edit Wikipedia who would agree that having them all in one long list like this is practical. The problem is awareness. The only reason I gathered to click on the link is that all my friends are out tonight and there's nothing better to do. Of only there was some way to raise awareness of the index page then maybe more people would vote to change it. People like the status quo because there's too many different option and they often can't be gathered to research them. Of only we could use something more prominant than the little banner at the top of the page. Most Wikipedia pages have some form of banner at the top, be it Proposed For Relation or Cleanup or Verge His Age With [Whatever] or His Age Needs Sources. To be frank, they melt into the foreground. Like roadcones or workmen's florescent jackets; they're designed to stand out but there's just so many of them that you don't even aknowledge their existence. I don't know if it'd be feasible to have some other, more prominent announcement on the page that encourages you to look at the discussion, but it's worth concidering. Perhaps the best way to deal with this issue is to change all the links to the long page with those to links to the index page, but leave the Discussion link in place. When if someone objects to the massive overhauled then they can go to the discussion to complain. But if they like it they will keep quiet and the page conforms to Wikipedia's standards for episode lists and then everyone's happy. Must something to concider.",

    "comment_text": "Well then there is one item I have to wait to talk about cause it is about the ending. I was impressed with the little physical traits of Thaw Morse that Than Evans gave us. The tug of the collar etc. I also liked the flushing out of some of the things in Morse's past that the original series had referred to over the years. I also like that we saw a young version of Max the pathologist as Peter Woodthorpe and John Thaw's interplay was a delight of the first three seasons of Morse. One question - Of this is going to be the only Endeavor episode shouldn't the page be moved to take series out of its title? Is much as PBS is a a part of my life I tired, several years ago, of how they mess with the British programs. To I bought myself a region free DVD player and have been ordering the series from Amazon UK. Amazingly the product is often cheaper - even with the shipping costs - than buying the DVDs from Amazon US and I get to see the programs before they air on PBS or BBC America - or as I know call it the Top Gear Gordan Ramsey channel. Sherlock has been brilliant and I love the jokes about Mycroft's weight. Speaking of Mark Gatiss who would have thought that one of The League of Gentleman ladies would be doing so many interesting things today. That also means that I should mention his one time colleague Steve Pemberton's WhiteChapel series. While not necessarily up there with some of our favorites it has had some interesting moments.

That said, do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researches to ensure an entry presents, as far as possible, an accurate, well-rounded picture of the subject? In the case of Is.

    "comment_text": "Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again. There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them. Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information. For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile. These are not meant as sources or references. They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors. The reason that they are included is summed up on of:of which states in part . information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content. IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include. His is why they are linked in the infobox. IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information. His is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information. For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am. The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films. Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources. IAFD works much the same. Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user reader whatever you want to call them. Filmography into comes from the production companies. You keep asking me for a source. I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article. Of you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number 2 next to it. That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article. When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered. Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity. The a, b, c that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article. That source is from Bitoni's publicist. It's as incredible as can be and is trusted. There, now that I've explained all of this, do you have any questions? Of so, please explain which point you don't understand. |(talk)",

    "comment_text": " Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. To English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Were is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Sudden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translated into English as mostly pejoratively. In German it's used as a decorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contents for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages. It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. Of you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasion responses. Of someone said that they are offended I would've stopped. Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what? ), justifying the educational component of the block by such lack of understanding is bordering insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blunders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. In administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves. of, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatory, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? Is I far I can see the guideline on the WP:of require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. One of that happened. of is a community-approved policy which takes preference over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin broadly interpret. A week is something that trills and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive? His whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edit that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admits in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushes which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.",

    "comment_text": " Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mode and admins, in general, have a very based view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles. present company excepted. I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly. He must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of bodies. He should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile looks is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile looks. Badly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributory exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logical examine a conflict is joyfully missing. It is inherently sewed. Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream. it simply isn't true, as has been prove here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condemning poor attitude towards derbies, than in improving the site? To no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mode, or who make up false accusations and allegation against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edit. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerable of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mode, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles! )? I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of keep off of article by a self-proclaimed (but verified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collection of information, let alone in the collaboration manner in which it is supposed to develop. It best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-derbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. To, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-central cesspit of fastness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newby contributory. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers!  )",

In the other hand, it is highly disrespectful to completely ignore what others have to say by not responding to specific replies to specific requests.

    "comment_text": "Regarding workstation, serves and mainframe I believe that workstation and serves are classes of computers, not sizes. For example, consider the IBM Power 595. It is a server, is it not? From the page, IBM seems to think so, and it certainly fits the definition of a server, with that being a computer that provides a service(s) to client(s). Now, consider the IBM Power 520. His too is a server, is it not? IBM thinks so, and it fits the definition. However, the Power 595 is not a desktop. It is nowhere near a desktop. It is a rackmount (IBM-speak: framemount) server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (201. 4 cm x 77. 5 cm x 180. 6 cm); and weight: (1,552 kg). I will personally give anyone who can fit this on an average office desk from Ikea, a cook. Now, the Power 520 is not a rackmount server. It is nowhere near a rackmount server. It is a deskside server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (540 mm x 182-328 mm x 628 mm); and weight: (40. 8 kg). I will personally give anyone who can convince a Fortune 500 company that the Power 520 is a top-of-the-line rackmount server, a cook. Two very different machines, both in hardware and form factor, but they are still both classed as a server. Clearly, as evidenced by this, serves can be in many form factors. A server can be a desktop, but it is not exclusively a desktop. Now the article is currently written seems to suggest that it is. A server can also be a rackmount, a tower, a blade, a deskside and a pedestal, to name a few. Workstation also come in more form factors than just desktop. Any serves are desktop (as in horizontal) and are small and light enough to be placed on a desk (the second, more historical definition of a desktop). However, they can also be in a deskside, tower, rackmountable or pedestal form factor, just to name a few. His can be remedied by not using classes to determine size. Instead, use form factors such as blade, rackmount, deskside, etc.",

In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-up on a conflict Anakin, the camera focused back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interesting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. Of Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. Of the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the true Sidious drip a bit more menace. That's all well and good, but there must be a within-universe explanation for it.",

There's a paragraph that states - Even though people can never own an article, it is important to respect the work and ideas of your fellow contributory.

I had proposed adding a better hatlink to the Ebola article but the editor who I am reverting now has a history of questioning my good faith and vigorously consisting almost any idea I have. I tried discussing even the simple hatlink first before just adding it and not only did he coral up a second for his point of view he then raced onto this page to change it to the bare bones hatlink as he has on the Ebola page. His is an egregious case of a subject matter 'expert , or so he claims, who believes he has the right to unilateral control of on his chose topics. Now look at the problem created as peopkle who intend to link to the epidemic get the pathophysicology page as I discovered on the page for Tom_Frieden which linked to the wrong page. without good hatllinks we are in a bad way",

I do know LK through the English history circuit and he is not the kind of person to wind up. His stems from the fact that he does have an awful lot of knowledge on the subject, but sometimes finds it irritating when people appear to trample his work. I remember him at one heritage weekend when he clearly showed that he doesn't suffer fools gladly. I do think that there's obviously been some sort of winding up going on, and they are both at an impulse. Having read the Templars webster history (briefly) it does seem a very good source and is very well presented. But I intend to read through it all and try and see what it is that Long doesn't like. The says on the dicussion that she claims it as not reliable but fails to mention exactly what is not reliable. I will therefore check it all.",

That you see the media doing is completely different from what someone in Melbourne sees, yes, I agree, so let's use the neutral term association football, which is the term for the sport on wikipedia.",

Of Jesus Bloodline is to be linked to esoteric Christianity it needs to be emphasised that it is to an traditional and modern version of esoteric Christianity that has been influenced by Margaret Starbird. And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origin of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a duelist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. His can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism believed that Jesus Christ was a human being, and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by biting scholar books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being. One of the comments here can be described as Original research.",

One big thing people are looking for is more information on how the song was made ,and its importance in pop culture outside of its sales statistics and music video, which are ususally small elements of a popular song's legacy (the exceptions are video by people like Michael Jackson). Being a number-one song, I'm sure places like MTV. com and VH1. com have articles about Stefani and the song, and she has to have done some magazine interviews (Rolling Stone, Spin, Blender, etc. ) on the song and or her album. Basically, information on why the song is important outside of its success. You should especially see if you can find some user reviews online of the song, to give an indication of its significant popularity in dance clubs (I've seen people lose their minds when Hollaback Girl comes on in a club). Also, since the Neptunes' stamp is so firmly printed into the song, a comparison (or at least a mention) of similar-sounding records the Neptunes have produced (several Kelis songs, Shake Ya Ass by [[Mystical], and, for the minimalist effect, Grindin' by the Clipse come to mind, but there are probably more and better examples). The other big thing is that it needs a write. Most of the article reads typical of the work of another Wikipedia user, who was known for writing long articles on pop songs that always needed prose clean (and he would often scream bloody murder whenever anyone would try). The big difference between the articles for Hollaback Girl and Cool are that Cool (song) goes into detail about why the song is important (it's about Stefani's personal life, and it explains how and why). Hollaback Girl isn't as personal or deep, true, but it's not a meaningless song at all. Must don't give up so early.",

By one-word addition to the article was first modified and then delete, so I opened a talk page here. The discussion has taken a disturbing turn, and seems to have hit a nerve of racial discomfort among some wikipedia editors.

Presumably this should say country, but what incident is this? Details! On't leave us in suspense! | Talk 08:53, May 26, 2004 (UTC) Homosexuality Sorry to overrule a point, but there is no creditable way to suggest that Richard was not homosexual, despite the fact that the category 'homosexual' did not exist in the middle ages. He had sex with men, many times, and showed almost no interest in women. Any respectable biography will say the same. I felt it was important to make this point, and have changed a sentence or two to reflect this, but not made a large deal out of it (for instance, not created a separate section). -It LouieThis is, IMO, a good point. There were a couple of lines devoted to this, as well as King Rick's inclusion in the GLBTQ article category, which were reverted by an anon as 'anon vandalia' (bizarre, no? ). His should be restored, as there is at least excellent anecdotes evidence that Richard did indeed have a renominating interest in men. 16:39, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)Again, Richard being a sexual or gay, met a person in denial (or person in some other way disturbed by the fact that there have been non-heterosexuals also in history as well as there are today), who on 29. 5. 2005 vandalized this article by removals. His time, the canal used the surname Alphax. Is above indicated, previous similar canal attempts occurred in March 2005 and December 2004. Hopefully the canal or canals are enjoined from such future activity. Alphax wasn't tantalizing, don't be ridiculous. He was removing what appears to be extreme speculation, written in poor English. You make a number of claims that would benefit from a source - where does Richard confess to being homosexual? Note also that the IP you were using to add the material the first time also added similar nonsense to Humphrey and Isabella's articles, including Category:Faghags to Isabella. I think you Adam should not be ridiculous. Of you look carefully at the edit history of this article, you see that most of those texts were added by other editors months ago. And you have the basic reference: the biography mentioned by that editor and listed in the references, obviously has answered your question. Please read it (I haven't - I trust on the previous editor - and I have not time to seek all books). Is to Alphax, since that person clearly did not read this talk page, nor offered here the reasons for removal, before removals, it is regarded as act of vandalia. I removed the stuff because it was badly written, lacked references,, and was there was a link to a webster that attempted to prove the claims, also without references. τεχ 08:10, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)The problem with Richard's alleged homosexuality is that no one, not a single primary or secondary source, from Richard's time unti WWII, ever mentioned that Richard liked men; in fact, he was often cited for his abnormal lust for women. The contrary view first appeared in The Plantagenets by J. H.  Harvey in 1949. The theory remains highly controversial and, to be honest, viewed with some skepticism by the mainstream academic world. It is a theory worth stating in the article, but it should be noted that there remains serious discussion on whether or not it's true. Well to be honest, you can simply remove that part entirely if you want. 62. 78 seems to have moved on to other articles, and I know I've removed his nonsense from a number of other articles with no further reaction from him. I think one of the arguments for it is his lack of offspring, legitimate or otherwise: one illegitimate child, if I recall correctly. But a bout of mumps or other infection could have curtailed his fertility. Or perhaps he was the ungenerous sort who didn't acknowledge his illegitimate kiss. The book Warriors of God is an excellent portray of King Richard's life, including his homosexual relationship with the King of France. That's exactly why I am a descendant of Hi",

That leaves four articles in which you might argue that I misjudged controversy. Of you take issue to that systematically, you'll quickly find that you'll have a problem with entire of:FOOTY. You accuse me of not assuming good faith in my first response, and I'll admit there is a grain of truth to that, but I'd ask that you hold yourself to the same standard.

Investment Advisers (the managers of hedge funds) in the US are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. There are many aspects of the Act that apply both to registered and registered advisers. The most important of these provisions are anti-fraud measures. The SEC enforce the Act. Registered was can count on a visit from the SEC on a schedule determined by the adviser fund's perceived briskness. To try and draw some kind of distinction between an adviser being regulated and a fund being regulated is painless: when the SEC visits, they are empowered to review all aspects of an adviser's funds. The SEC can use Rule 206(4)-8 under the Act to come in and look at an registered adviser's funds, as well. More, it is ludicrous to state that hedge funds are largely unregulated, although this phrase is repeated in the popular press frequently. In the US, hedge funds may be regulated by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various SROs and exchanges, state securities regulatory, the Department of Labor and maybe others. In addition to the Act, hedge funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act (for exclusion from the definition of an Investment Company) and the Securities Act of 1933 (Regulation D concerning sales of private securities). Any trading by direct investment hedge funds is subject to all the rules of FINRA and the exchanges. Of anything, regulation in the UK is even stricter. Solid regime exist in other jurisdiction, including Cayman and Bermuda. In short, it is the case in the US and the UK, among other major avenues, that hedge funds are (highly) regulated pools of capital. I will propose changes to the article as time permits.",

I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral animal to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version. The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, lawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monuments failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the perfection inherent in every human being, thus I designed it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer deluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameter of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuition program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psychic. Of I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother. Possibly v1 & v2 also had Ones? The Architect speaks of the animal being ineradicable despite his best efforts, in which case it would be present in the eutopia and dystopia versions too. His would explain why the Architect speaks of each version being identified by its animal, yet also says 'The first Matrix I designed', regarding the eutopia version, i. e.  v1.",

More questions seemed aimed at how close is editing WP to FB, and what would make it cooper more social media etc to you? Does no one remember we're supposed to be writing an encyclopedia? - Talk",

Now that I've thought about it more, it is most likely their mother renounced white nationalism and got rid of the band, and is now a church-going Christian. That's highly likely.

I'm not certain, but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all, as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work. His appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life, though Taveira is discussed on that page, and the claim could be true. He cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though.

    "comment_text": " I would advise you to concentrate, for instance, on Francis' commentary reproduced at footnotes 29 to the article (about the dirty presence - in Portuguese , presença suja - of Afro-Brazilians) and then to think if being highly critical of such a commentary can be considered as based Well, if you want to discuss technicalities and it-pick semantic, yes, it is based, but this isn't the particular issue I'm addressing. His article seems to be moved by an active lack of confidence in the reader's own judgment. The sentence is exclusively racism and it stands by itself. Now was it received overall? Positively? Relatively? Was there, as you said, a character behind it? Was that seen as a sorry excuse by many people? Met the reader know both sides, you won't build his opinion by concealing information - e. g.  Francis was indeed slapped by Tonia Carrero's husband, but later apologised. The reader will see this, and decide whether the apology was enough. The documentary by Hoineff mentioned by you in the link above received a critique in O Globo last Sunday for limiting itself to the usual line of saying how great Francis was and that his mistakes (his right commentaries) were only jokes, playing a character. It least sources more critical of Francis have the merit of taking him seriously It is on Wikipedia's POV policies that you have to represent the magnitude of each side properly. For instance, you see little merit in not taking him seriously. I too think sarcasm is sometimes an easy scapegoat, but the page isn't about my opinion or yours, it's about him and about the entirety of opinions available on him (e. g.  something like supporters claim he was often misinterpreted through his sarcastic person, yet critics think said person is used as an excuse for ignorant statements could be helpful). People themselves shall judge which position is more valid, no? Also, the Estadao article serves as an example of a supporter. Hours, of the Globo, remains as the example of a detractors - they both are based in their own ways, they both represent a significant fraction of popular opinion on him. I am defending that you and others actively give each side its due weight, and be confident enough in your own position that you let the overall percussion of his work speak for itself. Anyhow, thanks for keeping the Neutrality tag.",

Your keep vote would greatly be apprecaited as you are a champion on this site of Russian related military articles. Thank you! - :I have been well. I am sorry Husnock, the guy who added it is right: there is no rank called the Fleet Admiral of the Russian Federation. I used my Russian knowledge and there was none. Maybe it is a conjectual rank created by the US, just like the 6 star rank. ::It looks that way. It just seems very strange Russia now has no 5 star naval rank. -  Maybe, since the Russian fleet has sunk (no put intended) to low levels following the Soviet collapse, maybe they have no need for a rank like that. Good sir, I've done some more research and have rewritten the article. With all respect to the person who started the VFD (for his knowledge of Russian ranks is very substantial) I think this a conjecture rank that could be bestowed in times of war or national emrgency. I simply can't believe that there are currently no provisions in Russia to appoint a five star Admiral if and when the need arises. I am also left with the puzzling mystery of why there is an Army publication giving reference to the rank and pictures of the insignia available. With all the mysteries, I strongly feel the article needs to be kept. Your change back to keep would be certianly appreciated. - :P.
