You're looking at a trip of checks who've been through the mill! He've been to London, North Africa, we've flown on a plane all over Brazil! He learned an awful lot from all you fellow (I'll say! ), but there was just one thing no one would tell us. SNAFU! That is the meaning of SNAFU? That's it all about? An't figure it out! Is it contagious? Or simply outrageous? He hear it everywhere, SNAFU! Is it like a pill? Or is it a thrill? Is it a military secret? He asked a looey* who at first was rather formal, and then he laughed and shouted Situation normal! The greatest mystery in history! Run is fun, but why can't we find anyone to spill the beans? Well us what SNAFU Means! Is it something new that officers do? Is it a dropkick? ** Or only a topkick? *** SNAFU! Is it cold or hot? Inspected or not? Is it a pot**** - of GI coffee? He wrote a congressmen for further information. He said, “You'll have to start your own investigation! ” SNAFU! Now, fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone to spill the beans? Well us what SNAFU means! Bud = Any guy (you could substitute “Pal” or “Friend” or “Joe”). Thick = Girls, women. To go through the mill = To gain experience (usually not in a good way). To spill the beans = To reveal a secret (sometimes accidentally). = I think this is a naughty reference to military of (“short arm”) inspection. (of = STD) *looey = lieutenant **dropkick = a move in football (but here I suspect it’s something else, maybe naughty) ***topkick = sergeant ****pot = toilet (probably) GI = Government Issue = soldier(s’) SNAFU, BTW, means Situation Normal, All Tucked Up! Its counterpart are TARFU (Things Are Really Tucked Up! ) and FUBAR (Tucked Up Beyond All Recognition! ) All of the above are WWII slang.",

But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to National Socialism. And in the title of the entry for National Socialism, they write also called Nazism or Naziism. Your claim that use of the term Nazi is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routine use the term. The claim that National Socialism is a more full and correct designation is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that Nazi can be used as an epithet, so can dog. To you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word dog to describe dogs? It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term Nazi rather than National Socialist throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite. I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a sewed view of their politics. That part of Nazi politics do you feel has been sewed by their political opponents?",

    "comment_text": "Penis envyFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, searchFor the Grass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see . Envy. Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theories reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is caseation anxiety. In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals. Contents[hide] * 1 Freud's Theory o 1. 1 Criticisms of Freud’s theory + 1. 1. 1 Within psychoanalytic circles + 1. 2 Feminist criticisms * 2 Pale penis envy * 3 See also * 4 References * 5 External links[edit] Freud's TheorySigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article In the Sexual Theories of Children, but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work In Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Ex (1905). The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the pallid stage to the lately stage (see Psychosexual development). In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the pallid stage (approximately between the ages of 3. 5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the livid (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivation energy force within the mind) focused on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the pallid stage. His becomes the cataclysm for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcome for each gender because of differences in anatomy. For girls: * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother. * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis. * The desires a penis, and the power that it represents. His is described as penis envy. The sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis. * The develops a sexual desire for her father. * The girl blame her mother for her apparent caseation (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father. * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother. * The girl identified with her mother so that she might learn to mimi her, and thus replace her. * The child anticipated that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis) * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general. The offshoots of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father. A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the pallid stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of caseation (caseation anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identified with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general. Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",

Quoting Rushton is equivalent to using Ann Coulter as a prominent reference in the Kwanzaa article, or (if you still do not get the point), allowing a well educated klan member (on the basis that the concerned klan member is well-known) to claim that nigger are monkeys. That is the difference? Should every stupid opinion be included merely for the sake of balance? Perhaps yes, but there are (or should be) limits.

Beverly sounded a lot worse over the of than what the judges were hearing — they loved her performance when it sounded terrible from where I was sitting. In a firmly positive note, Same Difference were seriously good tonight! I have finally been won-over by those two because they actually delivered a decent vocal performace rather than marked around with drops on stage. Rhydian was so-so tonight in my opinion; he can do a lot better than that because his performance wasn't original. Wiki as well lost it halfway through her song and it sounded rough. I'm starting to like Leon a lot now. He's a better jazz-singer than a pop singer, hopefully we won't have another Ray Quinn on our hands!

I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button. To I wait until its over and wait for the video after the ad to load and then pause it and continue my video. 15 minutes later, history repeats itself. Seriously, I'm not going to buy any Dove products for at least the next months out of sheer fury toward that event. I funny if it's the people that own the ads or if it's you guns who maybe programme something incorrectly, but it's just awful, and I would like to suggest that you maybe change that. Myself and the person above CANNOT be the only people having these problems with Veoh.

Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. Is an example: Of a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. Of it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units. More ridiculous articles: Fundamental there of Calculus, Proof that 0. 999. . = 1 and Infinitesimals. ==",

Is I am the administrator who delete it, I'll give you some brief rational according to Wikipedia conventions and policies. I'm glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia, and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future. However, the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletions for two reasons:The article did not indicate why the subject met the criterion for inclusion that apply to business and organizations. It did not contain any veritable, third-party references. It was written in a promotion, rather than an encyclopedia tone. It appeared that the only contributory to the article (you) had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject. That is, it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business, rather than to improve the encyclopedia content of Wikipedia. Though your first article did not meet the standards for inclusion in an encyclopedia, we hope that you will continue as an editor here. For more information about Wikipedia policies and guideline, I suggest you take a look at the five pillars of Wikipedia. Of you have any more questions, please feel free to let me know on my talk page. Cheers, talk",

First, the unnamed first poster writes, . written by someone who almost certainly doesn't even know her personally. More likely, it was written by a bunch of different persons, not just one person, who doesn't know her personally. I would suspect at approx. 99% of articles found on Wikipedia about famous persons were written entirely by persons who did not personally know the person about whom they were writing. Now many people who contributed to the John Lennon page actually know John Lennon? Now many people who contributed to the Kurt Cobain page actually knew Kurt Cobain? Secondly, writes, Delete all that about Emilie bc you KNOW Mine would not want it here. It is irrelevant what Or. Mathers would want here or not. I'm sure George W.  Bush doesn't want certain things written on his Wikipedia page. Wikipedians are not in the business of making everyone feel come, but rather simply to provide objective information. Thirdly, writes, When Eminimemem gets time he will write a good article. I don't know if you're joking here or being serious. Either way, persons are not really supposed to control what content appears on their own wikipedia pages, unless of course they add something about themselves backed up with some legitimate source.",

Of someone notices that someone has worked for more than one thing then with 2 notable things someone has participated in I think that is enough grounds to create an article about the person. I didn't have the time to do any googling for Rin Asuka to find out if she had done anything else. Since you were looking for her, do you know of any other things she has acted in which have articles here? I am definitely interested in upbraiding this from a direct into a full article about the actress. I think this is better than just meeting it. Of you would tell me how you found out about her and wanted to look for her then we could use that to create an article. :Of there is not actually an article about a person then people should not make their name into a link. Directing the person's name to where they are mentioned on Wikipedia (a notable role) is good, but linking to their name when there's no article (creating a red link) and just leaving it would not be good. Shouldn't the dispute be with the person who made it into a link without checking if something was there first? Anyway, I'll take the initiative to do a little research about her to create an article. When people bring this to attention it is good because it encourages article creation. I would like to take similar steps with other actresses. The directs are basically a starting point for an article, something I would link to once the article is fully realized. ::You are not aware what the purpose of the red link is. That is why I linked you to of:Red link, a policy guideline whatever on Wikipedia. Having these actors who could possibly get into more notable roles (as I believe Rin Asuka has done, I just need to see if it is the same Rin Asuka) have their articles as red links is more useful than having them as directs to articles that have absolutely nothing about them other than one role they portray. That is why these directs you ahve created are useless to the project. It least users can see where the red link goes and comes from using Special:Whatlinkshere rather than have one page that is not about them define them. —",

In ethnic group is defined as such, the link between the Turkic people living there and the Azerbaijani is of ancestry for the Turkic people and Azerbaijani as the product. Both are not the same, they can not be the same, and no article about other peoples which would be neutral will use such a connection. In identity which did not exist at the time can not become extent because you can connect it with an ancestry. His does not make sense; we can then even claim the British and Germans to be the same. You did the same mistake on the Azeris in Turkey, which is basically full of original research… how on Earth could Turkic people having moved in what is now Turkey before the identity be considered as Azerbaijanis? From the same token, over half the Turks could be called Azerbaijani. Like you said yourself, we are not going to waste our time, I request a RFC on this article, and do you accept? -",

Must because some idiot Israelis and lost Sefaradim decided to highjack one of the oldest Chassidic traditions doesn't make them right. The Chassidus and the spelling of BRESLOV both preexisted modern Israeli Hebrew and it is inappropriate to transliterate the original word BRESLOV into English by way of modern Israeli Hebrew. The Rebbe (Rebbe Nachman of BRESLOV) warned the faithful Jews against the evil, vertical Zionists at the start of their evil movement. It is unacceptable for the Israeli highjackers to try to prevent the name of the town made holy by the Rebbe and the mesirus nefesh (self sacrifice) of the BRESLOVER Chassidim. The Rebbe's name is Nachman, don't try to transliterate it like an Arab or Sefaradi or idiot Israeli. You have no connection to the Rebbe! By family is BRESLOV back to the beginning.

To Reference for the Sheikh Saeed House's Map, what do you think? false allegation False alleations and face maps have been answered []. Please don't delete information, maps, documents and historical biting from ancient historian without cosulting other editors of this page ahead. His is organized tantalizing! You mentioned a webster that is Iranian and represent Iran's POV and cannot be neutral or reliable to judge a face map! Wikipedia and not affiliated to the Iranian government and doesn't represent one-side of ideology. His page is semi-protected not to be destroyed or vandalized by IP address users. Is editors here, you should not praise such behavior and immediately revert the page to its last review. Radical changes to refelect one-POV is not accepted. His behavior is going to be reported to Wikipedia adminstrators. Please consider helping instead of damaging or printing. Ralhazzaa The maps you have presented aren't anything new Ralhazaa. I can't believe people keep having the same discussions in this talk page over and over again. and everytime the discussions reach the same conclusion, but then after a couple of weeks another person starts the same painless round of edit. To be very brief (these have been discussed in length in different sections of the talk page and it's archives): 1. The maps you mentioned were prove to be inaccurate and were corrected in their later versions. verified through several articles and sources. 2. The UN resolution you mentioned does not certain to international bodies of water, but to bodies of water that are shared between two or more countries. There is a difference. For example Shat-al-Arab is a river which falls under that category. But international waters do not fall under that category and the UN geographical names committee approved the standard international name for them. To ralhazza. First of all we have discussed all issues here. There does not exist a single texture evidence for Arabian Gulf. He have about 300+ maps and 8 maps you brought from different books all have maps of Persian Gulf and their newer edition have been corrected. It is all there and you can not insert a POV without discussion. Head it again: []. Why aren't you bringing newer maps from the newer editions of those books and mentioning that texts calls it Persian Gulf? Perfect truth is not obtainable like this. How all POVs boys! I all,In this page, ancient deferential maps, situations from historical books, UN resolutions and policies is going to be added in brief to balance and neutralise this page, as many users wanted through this talk, considering the policies of editing on Wikipedia. Evaluating “Undue weight” cannot not to be decided only by small group of users, logical. These maps are going to show different side of information and represent different POV (not just by Arabs). Medieval maps, classical history references, UN organization reports related to solving dispute in geographical naming should show both POV for giving more neutrality in this page. Other users are required not to violate the using of references by saying It is incorrect! or False as long as it is apparently Ancient, Deferential, Internationally Accepted and Used, Showing different POV(s) and Neutral. References should have adequate level of credibility and neutrality of author source provider maker. Questionable references is something like this one as it is pr",

    "comment_text": "@Hans Adler, truth and or verifiabilityLet's talk about truth and or verifiability. You had corrected the name Stadtzeitung we have in note #4 of this article into Stattzeitung, because only the latter was veritable, you said. When, by chance, somebody found out the link to the Stadtzeitung für Freiburg and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the Stadtzeitung für Freiburg online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the truth would now be, erroneously, Stattzeitung. A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel. ;-)But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for pseudo-science, severe methodological flaws and actual errors. Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is veritable. But can we take it seriously? Of we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the christians. But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the severe methodological flaws and actual errors he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent excavation with the accusation of pseudo-science was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. His, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which purification is relevant? Van Hooff is refered to as a Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classic at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called Professor Associate. Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a professor on several webster. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. To what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? Of we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of numerous books and articles but specified only one title. Modesty or showing-off? Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a too director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most judges do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? Of we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category Pseudowissenschaft (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because bibulous, they discovered Van Hooff, taking him as proof, without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their bibulous allegation in an appearance of reality: it is only a quotation! ;-)To much about verifiability and truth.

    "comment_text": " == Pennsylvania is not named after William Penn. == The current version says: . which Penn named Pennsylvania, meaning Penn's woods. Is far as I know that is not correct, it was named Pennsylvania by King Charles II, against(! ) the will of William Penn. Either being a historian nor expert Wikipedia contributory myself, all I can offer to proof my claim is the Wikipedia article onPennsylvania which states: In February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[26] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[27] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[28] owed to William's father, Admiral Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history. [29] It was called Pennsylvania. William Penn, who wanted it called New Wales or Sylvania, was embarrassed at the change, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not renamed the grant. [30] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction. [29] This Wikipedia Article also lists   www. britannia. com celtic wales facts facts1. html as a source. Any historic books list a letter by William Penn to Robert Turner, written on March 5th, 1681 as a source. books. google. at books? id=of-IRN8PDnUC&lpg;=PA54&dq;=william%20penn%20robert%20turner%20with%20privileges%Of%20by%20the%20name%20of%20Pennsylvania%Of%20a%20name%20the%20King%20would%20give%20it%20in%20honor%20of%20my%20father. &pg;=PA54#v=onepage&q;&f;=false The letter reads: DEAR FRIEND: By true love in the Word salute thee and dear friends that love Word’s precious truths in those parts. Rhine I have, and for my business here, know, that after many writings, watchings, solicitings, and disputes in Council, this day my country was confirmed to me under the great seal of England, with large powers and privileges, by the name of Pennsylvania: a name the King would give it, in honor to my father. I chose New Wales, being as this a pretty healthy country; but Penn being Welch for a head, as Penmanmore in Wales, Penrith in Cumberland, and Penn in Buckinghamshire, the highest land in England, called this Pennsylvania, which is the high or head wood land; for I proposed, when the Secretary a Welchman, refused to have it called New Wales, Sylvania, and they added Penn to it: and though I much opposed it, and went to the King to have it struck out and altered; he said it was passed, and he would take it upon him—nor could twenty guineas move the under Secretary to vary the name; for I feared, lest it should be looked upon as a vanity in me, and not as a respect to my father, who he often mentioned with praise. Thou mayest communicate my grant to Friends, and expect my proposals: it is a clear and just thing; and my God that has given it me, through many difficulties, will, I believe, bless and make it the seed of a nation. I shall have a tender care to the government, that it be well laid at first. To more now, but dear love in the truth.",

I have to admit, I was secretly hoping you were going to tell me that a summary like the one in Styles would be sufficient, since it is a significantly less dancing task than a full sycosis. Alas, you are of the plot sycosis school of thought vis-à-vis plot summarise. In all honesty, then, I must further admit that while I don’t like writing synopses, I do like reading them! To, I guess I’m in the plot sycosis camp as well.  ) Mmm … now what? It walls me that the plot summary in The Big Four is unfinished and — if I understand the temple — has been for a bit of a while. But I don’t want us writing the equivalent of Coles Notes either. Mmm … maybe between the two of us, we can take a stab at it. I have another article that I have left by the wayside that I should get back to, but since I think virtually no one else on Wikipedia even knows it exists, I can leave it a bit longer. I guess the only way to tackle this would be chapter by chapter. To you think that chapter sub-headings would be too much? Also, any other tips for writing synopses? By problem is that I am an infinitely better “editor” than a “writer”. I look forward to hearing from you. Please respond here as I have your talk page watched. Ciao for now! —",

Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text. All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, geology, LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.

In my eyes it undermine your position as an impartial arbiter and reflect upon your reputation. Overall in my view your handling of the matter has been so far lacklustre at best. You practically admitted that your decision to block me was made on impulse (you initially put a wrong reason as grounds for the block). It seems you are concentrated on watching me while turning a blind eye on how I am being treated. When one of the accusers calls me an 'unfortunate fell' and you choose to ignore it, am I correct to assume that I can also call my opponents 'unfortunate fellow' or you as a watchdog will block me for another 'personal attack'? I think your last remark is absolutely warranted. Please stop telling people not to post here? I was not telling I was asking and very politely for that matter, as I do not want my talk page to be turned into an incoherent pile rather than than what Wikipedia creator intended it to be. I think your popping up like that and commenting a minor post of mine looks like another impulsive decision unworthy or an administrator, and also comes dangerously close to what may be interpreted as open bias and prejudice. I kindly ask to get off my back - you really need not be there, I am not such a loose cannon that scrutiny of every little post of mine would be justified. I perceive such excessively close 'guidance' as pressure, and I will act accordingly if I feel your actions contradict your status of an administrator. His is not a threat - it's a statement of my position and my intentions if such treatment continues.",

Your opinion and original research do not tramp mainstream present-day encyclopedia of scientific biography and modern biographies of Tesla which include Physicist as a description. You claim writers say and then cite exactly one book, in contrast to the many I cited which called him a scientist or physician. Binksternet is wrong when he says Tesla did not leave detailed records. After his funds were gone and he was just a retired broke eccentric, talking about rayguns, then indeed he did not do scientific publication. But for earlier work he gave many well followed public demonstrations to scientific audiences which were written up in detail by himself and others, and he wrote volumes about his own work in radio, x-rays, his remote-control boat, tireless power to light lights, rotating magnetic fields, and induction motor, in the 19th century. His publications were numerous. Of he were merely being evacuated for nobility as a scientist, one might look at Google Scholar and similar situation sites to see if he published and if his papers were cited by others. He gave well-received lecture-dempnstrations to learned societies, for example. See High frequency oscillates for elector-therapeutic and other purposes, 1898, A new system of alternate current motor and transformer, 1888, Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential 1904, Experiments with alternate currents of very high frequency and their application to methods of artificial illumination 1891, Tesla, Nikola.

His is not a complete listing, but it shows him as publishing his work in an exemplary way, and these publications have been cited by later workers.

German losses were 86,064 men,[145] the Red Army lost 429,890 men this is exactly the same . for german the losses without breakdown and for russians the same. now the real story. dapi marked the russian casualties with dubios, than he checked his sources and found out that this numbers are exact krivosheev, then he splited the number in wounded and killed, to varnish that he simply did a mistake with marking this number as dubios. u must note that the german numbers is still simply 86,00 men ^^Well, this one. He quotes two selected words and the rest completely out of context, in effect ignoring that Glantz writes the Mius operations were successful and achieving their objective of diverting German mobile forces from Kharkov. dapi provided a source by glantz claiming the russian units diverted german units, this is not disputed by me but i added that the divertion operation himself was a disaster, where is the problem ? the first sentence explained that the operation was succesful and i added that militaryoperation himself was unsuccesful. dapi wanted only the good of the operation. but i admit the version now is betterHe also claimed that this information was on p.  230 of Glantz; it was not. lol thats called failurer, and i admited already to hohum, funny is that while u provided faced sources for prokhorovka i see no excuse of u, nothing. u dont respond, u did a failure but u dont comment. i comment everything if people ask me. again i can provide sources and everything to support my opinion, i would appreciate if dapi does the same and we discuss here who was wrong",

Is for his competance, that was always open too. Being a balls to the wall aggressive cavalryman doesn't make him a military genius but being so, winning, and surviving is close. And in the end, close isn't always good enough. After Gettysburg he encountered General Longstreet and tried to convince General Lee's stout lieutenant he had him outnumbered and out gunner. He requested Longstreet's surrender in person. Longstreet ordered his staff to bring several Confederate divisions up to attack including General Pickett's. In reality these divisions existed only on paper and Pickett's was crushed at Gettysburg. But Muster bought Longstreet's bluff and retreated with his tail between his legs.",

    "comment_text": "of, I can see why you'd like a legitimate source like that for a photo for the same reason that we require information be verified by was in the text. However, the problem I'm seeing is that it strikes me as simply not feasible. Of a photo appears from a reliable source, that photo is going to be copyright by that reliable source. There's no way we could claim fair use in that situation. In my experience, almost all non-fair use images are either user-generate, taken from a Flickr (or something similar), or have had their copyright expire. Of we limit images to those from reliable sources, we pretty much limit ourselves to only fair use images and images of historical subjects. I think that is simply unreasonable. User-generate images and images released under a free license have a role to play on Wikipedia. I think it is up to us as editors to determine that role. In the examples I gave above, do you find it inappropriate that the articles use images with unclear provenance and or that are not reliable source? Of not, why not? By point here is that the question Days who? could be asked of pretty much any user-generate image or image taken from Flickr, and I don't see why this article is being held to a different standard. And I haven't tried very hard to argue for its inclusion because I don't think it's that great of a picture. I just disagree with the grounds on which it is being excluded, namely that we need some form of legitimation for the image. I agree that we should have some method to determine whether or not this photo (or any) accurately represents the subject. I don't think we need to get the photo from an of to do that because I think that places far too high a burden. I think it is up to us, the editors, to determine whether an image adequately represents the subject. To I think relying on someone else to say, Key this is me being a sister is sufficient? Of course not. I, personally, judge the photo based on my own knowledge of sister aesthetic, and the ironic mustache and flannel shirt are enough for me. While neither of those elements is mentioned in the article, I don't think it should be too hard to find an of or two that mentions them in connection with sisters.",

The user evhs00 has basically been copying the Los Alamos High School article. (see for yourself). Problem is that he's copied a great deal of stuff that does not apply to EVHS. For instance he makes a serious of false, baseless and dubious claims: EVHS was one of Newsweek's 2007 1,000 West High Schools in America (#598). His was baselessly copied from the LAHS article and is just false when applied to EVHS:   www. newsweek. com id 39380 ? sort=Rank&count;=1351&Search;=&start;=500&limit;=100&year;=2007& EVHS is mostly middle class. A dubious claim considering espanola is one of the poorer cities in one of the poorest states and has 21% of its population living beneath the poverty level:  www. city-data. com city Espanola-New-Mexico. html Any other claims are suspect, uncited, and bear a clear similarity to claims on the LAHS article. Additionally, The image of the sundevil moscow was taken from the Arizona State University article and is not fair use. The image of the basketball team was taken from the EVHS Athletics webster and is not fair use. Basically there's no situations anywhere and the author's methodology is clearly one of latent copying. I really want to avoid an edit-war between rival high school articles so I'm not going to touch the EVHS article. I'm actually really glad that somebody is working on the EVHS page.

Your addition itself is good, however, as you did add and correct Dong Cheng, we have lost a good opportunity to check the abilities and knowledges about Dong Cheng of Benjitheijneb. Now I am very surprised by the fact that Zhu Zhi was now created by Benjitheijneb. He could not find Zhu Zhi at List of people of the Three Kingdoms, However Dong Cheng page contains his name. I am waiting the day Benjitheijneb makes Zhu Zhi. It seems that he transfered the reposibility of creating the Zhu Zhi to others. ( )Please of NOT remove Zhu Zhi in Dong Cheng page and let's see how Benjitheijneb creat Zhu Zhi. Probably a Hewbrew translation of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Records of the Three Kingdoms contains Zhu Zhi. ( )",

Cavaliers (loyalists) was moved from Cavaliers yesterday, before the name had one plural now it has two! There are around 400 wiki pages linked to this topic none of the others pages with the word Cavalier in them come close to that number of links ===Survey=== :Add *Support or *Oppose followed by an optional one-sentence explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~ ::*Support Takes perfect sense to me. Standard should be to use the singular form in its most common meaning as the base article. - ::*Support That's a good idea to move it. It's very silly for cavalier to direct to one particulary form of it. - ::*Support Seems very sensible indeed. ::*Oppose In truth I support a move but not nessecerily this move. Cavaliers (loyalists) does need some changing, yet with all the cavalier (disambiguation) it seems improper to be placing this article as the Calavier. Cavaliers, as presented in the intorduction and on the Roundheads article seems like a sound alternative. :One. ::*Support a move that seems to have been properly made, then improperly reverted. The primary meaning is the royalist one, the others are derivative and minor. A search on the Paladin and Cavalry pages finds no mention of the word in articles that are supposedly a disambiguation of its meaning. Oddly, there is no mention of cavalier as an adjective which refers to the supposed attitude of the loyalists. Is said before, the standard should be the singular most common usage, which this clearly is. , ==Further discussion== Oppose Her above comment from Dryzen, pointing Cavalier(s) to this specific instance, albeit the apparent original occurence of this term. In addition, I've directed all the instances of the above 400 to Cavaliers (loyalists). Perhaps a double plural is invalid however having fixed each of the links to point to the specific article seems to fit the criterion above, so I'll move if there is not objection. met :You, , moved the page to Cavaliers (loyalists) at 02:03, 29 April 2006, less than a minute after you posted the above. That does not seem to me a sufficient time to see if there is not objection to you reverting a of:of move! I object strongly to your revision. His was an agreed of:of move, of which I informed you personally on the day I proposed the move and here is your reply on my talk page . ::By apologies Philip, you are correct that more time would have been appropriate.

(I get the idea that you quite agree with me as a valid response, and don't agree with me as bullshit. ) And once again you are attempting to avoid the question. what is not neutral about the article? of:CIVIL refers to this as feigned comprehension. Learn how to stroll up. Nothing feigned about it. I think this article is excrutiatingly neutral in tone, so I really do not see how you can think otherwise. In any case. since you don't seem to want to discuss your concerns point by point. I have responded to them all below. You have not prove that this article is excruciating neutral. You are simply reacting defensive and irrationally. You may have invested a lot into it already, and that may be disturbing your perspective. Is someone looking in from the outside, it appears, on no uncertain terms, that this article is based. In addition, you have demonstrated a lack of self-control, compassion and objectivity, which are all needed to make unbiased statements. I wish I had more time to take part in the discussions these days, but best guess is that 'current version' =! 'his version', therefore 'current version' =! neutral. I would suggest that the current version is as close as an article of this kind is going to get - it reports simple facts (per of:V) without taking a bias as far as possible (per of:NPOV). His is not saying that todays version can't be improved though, but 's changes were not an improvement. Off course, if we were apply of:UNDUE and of:FRINGE heavoly to this article we might as well delete the whole thing - but thats beside the point. I would argue that the neutrailty tag is missed on this article. You don't have enough time to engage in discussion, yet you are certain that the neutrality tag is missed and you apparently have enough time to click undo. Your sincerity is questionnable. Vice ad hominen there, but perhaps you had something more usefull to add to the discusson? Flamebait. Lock puppeting. responding to Uku's points Met's try again. since you don't seem to want to discuss them point by point, fine. I will deal with them all together:The article uses the phrase in the broadest terms which clearly shows intent to diminish or otherwise misrepresent the subject matter. The exact sentence is: Masonic conspiracy theories are a sunset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. In broadest terms, these theories claim that Masonic conspiracy theories are a sunset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. His is a statement that summarize a broad concept that is common to most of the theories. Wikipedia's style guideline say we are supposed to summarize the article in broad scope in the intro. that is what we do (even a quick look at the list shows that most of the theories claim this in some way. Now is it not neutral? It insinuates that the subject matter does not warrant serious consideration. Besides, that phrase is not only false, but exaggerated False? It's a very accurate description, but the meaning don't change much if we write it to ''Masonic conspiracy theories are a sunset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. These theories claim that Masonic conspiracy theories are a sunset of conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry. - it just turns the last sentence into a fragment and a repeat of the first.

    "comment_text": " Items Not Met Ready For Crime-Time Scholarly Review on Wikiversity Is you may know, KillerChihuahau summarily baleeted these essays from the pages of Wikiversity, presumably because she disagrees with the notion of using the donor-funded site to educate 21st Century youth in modern concepts of ethical organizational management. Moulton Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans Is a Governance Fool The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blow. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right. The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history. The thing that studied me was the prominence of blocking and banking as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context. And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Rode of Hammurabi of 1760 of. Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:1. Of any one ensnared another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death. Evidently, banking (ostracism) was a common practice in the trial cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and serious banking was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of trial overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause. And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bank without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic trial ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it relates the advent of the Rule of Law. When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it. The irony here is that Wikipedia purport to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution. The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and ready the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by uprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization. The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Tales foolishly and mindlessly interjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banking wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first single it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture. To what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Rode. Is Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake. Or as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh! “''Further comments by readers of the P2P Foundation may be found [  blow. p2pfoundation. net",

The Cold War did have something to do with it, as least as regards America's decision to back Chamoun by sending marines.",

I think you have some sort of god complex where you sit there and wait for people to contribute TONS of work, then simply revert it just for the sake of trying to gain some sort of control. You keep referring to 'personal attacks'. Have you ever thought that maybe your just insecure? You view everything and everyone as attacking you? (I checked the many other comments on your own talk page) I'm not personally out to get you believe me. The reference that it grew out of the Acid House movement is right there - that is the source. I don't need to repeat this. I think there is something wrong with you if you need some book to tell you that this record is NOT Trance, and it is NOT from the Acid House movement. It clearly shows you were not part of the original scene and you are no longer qualified to speak on the early years. By guess is you came into the scene around 1992. It's expressly forbidden to listen to it? I think your going off here. His webster is about music, I think it is important to actually hear what we are talking about. In fact references to the actual vinyl release for most statements on this page hold more merit than books or articles. Why? Articles written on Trance are highly suspect and not scholar sources. Even if they were written from some 'reputable source', half the time it is written by some need who has it completely wrong, or interview by some of who has an adgenda to 'attach himself' as some creator. Such like anything else they are opinions. The actual vinyl records themselves and the dates they were released are more relevant than any book. (I can't remember how to do the line break sorry)",

Nachiket (Sanskrit:नचिकेत,Naciketa, Bengali: নচিকেতা) is the child Pornographist in an ancient Hindu fable who would paint the nature of young children though the name has several earlier references. He was taught Self-knowledge, the separation of the human soul . Nachiket is noted for his rejection human values and grave for material desires which are ephemeral, and for his single-minded seffish pursuit . During the colonial era, they were made to work as slaves in stone quarrel and sleep with he pigs . They also had children with the women and the children automatically were given their fathers' last names. Anglo Indians who came back to Africa also carry this last name. Among some of those people are the Tabom people, descendants of Kamats, a black man from India, once known to be the ugliness man in East India due to his involvement in the slave trade in Esat India.

It is fine to say that there have been confirmed instances of ambulance and fleeing civilians being hit, but to use language like clearly marked and prominently waving white flags is completely unacceptable and should be removed. Also, I will request again that some mention be made of Hezbollah's use of warheads filled with ball bearings (whihc are designed to minimize human casualties). All mention of this was removed, apparently by POV canals. The part about the ball bearings was moved down and is now next to the part about Hezbollah using civilians as human shield, I believe.",

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparatory and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparatory who worked for me was also responsible for helping rep and customize the storage areas, photographic objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installation, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. Is you described I often engaged outside art candles when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

Of you want to have the image removed from the article or only linked to it, then by all means engage in consensus building mechanism to achieve that balance. Without it, you will be engaging in revert warring. You've been blocked twice already for of:3RR violations. Please, don't let it happen again.

I'm a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently, and now that I'm getting to the end of my training I'd love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training. Is you can see, I'm fairly new to the editing scene, so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated. Regarding my recent edit on the Hypertension article, as I mentioned in the talk page I'm basically trying to find a way to get rid of the dancing wall of text problem that I feel the article has at the moment. I'd like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research, but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering what's that? can brows with relative ease. Is such, I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content (most of which is only relevant to medical professional) on specific pages, and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. Met me know what you think about this approach, and please modify my submission or revert them as you see fit.",

The may well have a 5-octavo range, but singers are defined by their *effective* range, not merely the pitch boundaries of their natural range (including the falsetto). However, Carey is a phenomena singer regardless of her full range. Well, I have a range of over three octavo, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i. e.  I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. To, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octavo and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her conditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determine of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think of is simply phenomena in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no of.  )",

While the story might seem pleasing to one of the sides, I do not see any resolve in it, There are also known border skirmishes with numerous casualities for almost all the 18 years since 1920. Ruling of the Hague tribunal in 1931, that Lithuania does not have to allow Polish transit through Lithuanian territory, only proved the status quo. I'm not sure, but as much I do remember, Hague ruled this, declaring Poland as aggressor in Vilnius case. To make sure I'll need to check my books. Lithuanian government did understand, that after the coup there was small possibility, that Poland would use the coup to justify aggression against Lithuania. It seems Pilsudski did also understand that as a possibility. In his diaries there is a record from 1927: could not sleep all night, considered whether to attack Lithuania.

I may add that his 2 essays on Baudrillard were accepted for publication at the International Journal of Baudrillard Studies:   www. ubishops. ca baudrillardstudies  so your testimony to their worthlessness seems silly and rather petty of you. Yes I created this page and 2 more (Frank Popper and Ebon Fisher) but after this experience there will be no more content supplied by me. There are of claims of global influence - only specific facts concerning all three pages I created for you. Of you object to my linking his early work to sunk - then remove that reference but please stop your pettiness. RydernechvatalI think you dodge the issues at hand completely. The issue here is the integrity of the online encyclopedia. To place Nechvatal into the field of college artists, on par with Matisse, is patiently disrespectful to this project. There are thousands of artists who do college, and very few deserve mention on Wikipedia. By brother is an artist but you won't find me putting him all over Wikipedia! He just doesn't have the stature required. That's not a criticism of his work (or of Nechvatal's), it's a statement about what an encyclopedia is for. May I suggest you build Nechvatal a nice MySpace page? Similarly, to place a 2 page review on Baudrillard alongside the remarks of Susan Sontag is not helpful either. The point of the encyclopedia is not to list every possible thing connected to Baudrillard (in which case Nechvatal's piece would qualify); the point is to discuss and link things which help introduce and illuminate someone at the scale of an encyclopedia. There are thousands of published articles on Baudrillard and very, very few of them have a place on Wikipedia. The same is true of sunk visual art and so on and so forth. You really don't own up to any of this. His is why the charge of pettiness applies well to you: if you truly took responsibility, you would remove your additions and links yourself, rather than ditching this chose to the community. But that's the basic misunderstanding here: Wikipedia is not about individual promotion, by self by fan or by family, it's about a community of people building knowledge in a collaboration way. Dylanfly Nechvatal, as a collagist, is discussed in Brandon Taylor's recent book Collage published by Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2006, p.  221. Perhaps your brother is in that book as well? Thus I have nothing to own up to. For the first situation: He has also exhibited in Paris, Cologne, Alalst, Belgium, Lund and Munich and has participated in museum exhibition around the world. [situation needed] see the artists of here for list of exhibition :   www. eyewithwings. net nechvatal bio bio. htmFor your 2nd situation for his work being in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. [situation needed] see:   www. msstate. edu Fineart_Online Backissues Vol_15 faf_v15_n04 text review03. htmlFor #3: Art historian Donald Kuspit has written in his essay The Matrix of Sensations that Nechvatal's digital painting demonstrates that there are more possibilities of freedom in digital art — that is, the mental elements are free[r] to enter into various combinations and thus to be manipulated — than in architecture, painting and sculpture. [situation needed]see:   www. artnet. com magazineus features kuspit kuspit8-5-05. asp which is cited in the reference section For #4: Frank Popper states in his book From Technological to Virtual Art that Nechvatal's computer virus work is important to the history of art as it has advanced the use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, while defending and preserving the values of formal painting. [situation needed] see: Frank Popper From Technological to Virtual Art, MIT Press, pp. 120-123This is also cited in the reference sectionDoes that help? Rydernechvatal",

I was editing in good faith, I wanted to add into from a wide range of sources instead of just relying on just the NRHP which is something you brought to the table, I really wanted to bring something different and contribute myself.

    "comment_text": ", 24 December 2014 (UTC)It's pretty obvious what I would have liked to hear from you, but I suppose intentionally ignoring people is the way of Wikipedia. His situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it delete for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it). And I've already given you extensive reasons why 'write it yourself' isn't really going to cut it as a solution. I'm not going to write it, and neither are they. Nobody is going to. Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a possible first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. He, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so cap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively document). Which merely leaves me still wondering why any of you think this sort of approach would motivate me, or anyone else who realises this is the way of Wikipedia, to fix write the articles for you. You must really think people are fools. 17:46",

Beware! Nevertheless, here is the request I have been making: To make a long story short, a couple of us were suspecting that some users that suddenly appeared out of nowhere making trouble and backing each other up were sockpuppets, and, it turns out, they more or less incriminate themselves. Head all about the festivities at Talk:Jehovah's_Witnesses#Dispute tags for Positive and Critical Links Sections, something one of them started in support of the other (sorry that there's a lot of unrelated stuff there), and the initial suspicions at Talk:Jehovah's_Witnesses#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a depositors of links, images, or media files. But now that these first two basically incriminate themselves, we need to check on a few other users that also aroused suspicion before going around slapping sockpuppet tags on pages. I simply request a yes or no answer to a simple question: are these people from Denver (or the surrounding area in Colorado) too? Of course, if you do find some kind of smoking gun, that would be of utmost interest. Following is the list: I would personally doubt that every single one of those is actually a sockpuppet, but I only seek the yes or no answer to that one question (barring a smoking gun(s) of some kind), nothing that is especially useful to anybody for anything other than confirming or swelling suspicions of sockpuppetry.

I also appreciate the link to the rule you cited. I found it fascinating and will be useful for my lectures, as to the use of WP as a source. Thanks again! 2001:558:6007:27:7992:7DA3:D702:EE6A",

Firstly, Oceania is a geopolitical continent, not a biogeographic or geological one. From the geopolitical point of view, East Timor is in Asia. From any other point of view, Oceania doesn't exist. Either way, East Timor is not a part of Oceania. Secondly, reputable sources have been presented, which state straight out that East Timor is in Asia. They may not state their criterion, but they are ambiguous in their position. You, on the other hand, are unable to present any sources, and are relying entirely upon reasoning.

The debate spanned dozens of books, scholar articles, and conferences and was consistently reported on in the press.

In the existing photograph, there are two copyright to consider: the copyright held by the photographer on the photograph itself, and (perhaps) the copyright held by the toy manufacturer. Of you were to create a new photograph of the toy and license that photo under a free license, we would still have to claim fair use on the representation of the toy, but not on the photograph itself (which would be free). With the current photo, we unnecessarily have to use a non-free photo (rather than a free one) to represent a non-free underlying product.

It's a very hard thing to get over but we will remember him forever in everyday life, Mr Parrott said. Mr Rosenberg had worked for Was for four years. He was a keen member of the Apollo Players and music was his great love. He travelled the world as a drummer in the Men Toller Fig And in the 1970s.",

I see it's a subcat of Category:Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country; I don't know about other countries but it's not the right name for encompassing all the interrelated issues in Ireland. Pretty much every word is questionable. There is abuse, subtypes child abuse and sexual abuse, and the intervention child sexual abuse. Any institutional abuse victims, especially girls, were not sexually abused. Magdalen foundries' inmates were mostly not children. All these can occur either in the context of a Catholic religious organisation or elsewhere. Not all institutions were run by religious orders, or by Catholics. Not all sexual scandal resulted from abuse (arable example Eamon Casey). Not all abuse results in scandal; aggregate abuse statistics can never be NPOV described as scandalous. Does Ireland mean the island or the state? The state institutional set was different in Northern Ireland, but the diocesan set was not. (Brendan Smyth)I'm not sure the ultimate supercat Abuse in Ireland would be an appropriate name. But I do think some overall reigning and reading is needed; and if convenient then subarticles and subcategories could supplement it.",

    "comment_text": "Cornea Transplant SurgeryAn eye is considered to be one of the most important part of the human body. Eyes are organs that perceive light and forms a communication with the brain providing all the necessary data. The brain then processes the raw data and acts accordingly. In eye is a complex component of the human body comprising of various and sensitive minute parts. A transparent front part of the eye that acts a protection shield for the iris and pupil is cornea. Sensitivity, transparent and presence of immune cells make cornea a very special tissue. Cornea transplant surgery is an operational method in which a damaged cornea is replaced by donate cornea tissue. It is very much admissible to consult a trained cornea surgeon in India and expert for successful cornea transplant forgeries. Cornea TransplantationCorneal transplantation surgery, a process in which damaged cornea tissues are replaced, is also referred to as cornea transplant. It is one of the most successful organ transplantation forgeries in the world. Replacement of cornea can restore completely or partially lost vision, reduce pain and improve the efficiency of cornea. Also known as keratoplasty, the transplantation surgery is considered as successful sight saving operation for improves the optical quality of cornea. Some of the conditions that might require cornea transplantation include malfunctioning of cornea’s inner layers, keratoconus (bulging or change in shape of cornea), swelling in cornea and tissue growth in cornea. Occasionally cornea transplantation surgery is combined with various reactive forgeries, attract forgeries and many such forgeries. Owing to technological developments and medical advancement, the number of cornea transplantation forgeries in India has increased subsequently providing sustained protection from cornea diseases. Honor Cornea TissueCorneal transplantation includes replacement of damaged or diseased cornea by donor cornea tissue. A thorough evaluation of donor cornea is essential for the success of cornea transplantation surgery. Due to latest inventions in the field of medical science, today a single donor cornea is divided into 3 parts and is used in different patients for improving visual city. Detailed screening of human donor cornea during transplantation of cornea ensures successful transplantation surgery. However there are many risks involved in the surgery. These risks are relatively very small but they can cause hazardous effects if the surgery is not done under proper care. Some complications that could occur are bleeding, eye infection, increased sensitivity to light, rejection of new cornea, increased redness of the eye and many such dangerous complications. Hence it is always advisable to consult a cornea disease treatment specialist for successful treatment of cornea disorders. Recognized eye bank in India and renowned centre of cornea disorder treatment offers keratoplasty, keratoconus, cornea oedema and cornea transplantation surgery in India. Contact specialist cornea surgeon for treatment of various cornea disorders through advanced methods. Or. Vinay Agarwal provides treatment for cornea disorders and restoring full eye vision through cornea transplant surgery in India including transplant of donor cornea tissues.",

    "comment_text": " JIDF posts image for Wikipedia Were's a situation I found intriguing. The JIDF blow specifically posted an image to put on this Wikipedia article. The heading currently reads Better Sample of the Groups He Target (For Wikipedia). His strikes me as problematical. It the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is download from the blow image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08. ) I'm sorry if you've already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting france. West wishes, | Talk I don't like the way the JIDF is manipulation this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blow is a of:of for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) Am. That's interesting. The JIDF is only marginal notable (only two major press situations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn't display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a log, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance. Maybe we should drop that image. It looks like the JIDF doesn't want to be on Wikipedia after all. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) It this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I'm assuming that of:BLP does not apply to organizations, right? ) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I'd be interested in hearing the pro's and con's for keeping the image. (Side from the promotion concern I've floated above. ) X, | Talk I think there may be copyright problems, because (for example) the Hamas log is subject to copyright. I've brought the question up at Wikipedia:Copyright problems. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don't have screenshots. They don't even have pictures other than the log, and those are organizations with physical offices, known officers, and big real-world events. The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home login page. Miniclip has a screen shot of their huge home page in their into box. LinkedIn just has a log. Space has a log and a picture of the headquarters building. One of these Wikipedia pages have screenshots of interior web site pages. Wikipedia doesn't usually do that. But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. To it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group's activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blow sites? After all, it could as well be an independent screenshot of the target group, without JIDF as the source. See what I mean? | Talk Must to clarify, there was already a sample up. I read the blow and they made a point saying that the original sample only showed anti-semitic groups and not the terrorist groups, and I wanted to learn how to add an image, so I replaced it. I don't care if there's a photo up or not, but I do feel if there's going to be one, that it should be the most accurate",

    "comment_text": " :Listen, S' is the new rest system of the rickets after the acceleration is finished. Why is this so hard to understand? To if you perform a Lorentz transformation of points A and B, from system S (where the ships are moving with v after acceleration) to S' (where they are at rest after acceleration), you are calculating the endpoints of resting objects in S', thus you have the rest length of the objects and the distance between the endpoints. And what do the Lorentz-Grafts tell us? Well they unambiguously show that the distance between A and B (again, those are the coordinate of the endpoints of in S' resting objects) has increased as compared to the coordinate length between A and B in S.  Of course, this is in perfect agreement with relatively of simultaneity, which shows that the spaceships started at different times in S', thus they had different accelerations. :Summarizing: 1) You have two endpoints A and B with different accelerations in S', therefore they are moving away from each other in S', and after the acceleration the distance of the now resting objects has increased, and the string has been stretched. 2) Of course, one can also choose frame S in which the accelerations appeared to be the same due to relatively of simultaneity, and therefore the increased distance in S' apparently stays the same in S.  (Actually, one should abandon the word appear in relatively, it serves no purpose and only districts one from correctly applying the Lorentztransformation. ) :Now, Dewan, Beran, and Bell unfortunately started with 2) and only afterwards at 1), so they had to focus their attention mostly on S and on length contraction, which caused much confusion by some readers. But the paradol is much easier to understand if one (like Petkov and Franklin) starts with 1) and then look at 2). :BTW: Is explained above, modern authors understand the paradol very well, and some of them even try to confirm it experimentally (Bell's spaceship paradol in electron interferometry, ).",

These allegation were made only first 50 years after they allegedly happened when Shirley Tempole wrote her autobiography and vested her anger over my grandfather giving the relatively unknown Judy Garland the part of Dorothy over very well known Shirley Temple. There has never been a shred of evidence incdluing third party statements to substantiate these untrue and harmful to our family outrageous charges. Further, I see some idot has written on wikipedia about some previous editing of these false statements referring to my grandfather as a child abuses. Wikipedia as one of the Internet's most respected sources of information should respect the foundation of American jurisprudence innocent until prove guilty and remove this ridiculous and painful statement. Of you wish to discuss this further with me, please contact me directly. I would appreciate both the courtesy of a reply and to see that Wikipedia will correct this terrible injustice to my grandfather and our family by remocing totally unsubstantited false allegation.

These guns are all now commenting on here because I practically had to beg them to get stay involved. I had people like I am One of Any and Krystaleen calling me a vandalizer, summer, advertised, promoter, and every other name in the book with absolutely no merit whatsoever, and no repercussions against them for publicly wandering me! I have stated that a hundred times now, but they still do not get it I guess. You are an administrator Kinu, you can block us, deny us, kick us off, or do whatever it is that you do and we are powerless against it, except by formal dispute according to Wikipedia policy, but why even go there at this point. I missed up by sending you the existing article as a brand-new article the other night, and you denied it Kinu. I admit that I was not sure how to do that, even AFTER reading about how to on Wikipedia. It was an honest mistake! That is why I asked Shawn to do it for me last night, so it would be done correctly. An you PLEASE let us make the accurate corrections Kinu, and if anybody complains, I will quit Wikipedia because I know that they won't if Shawn's proposal is followed. It is common sense! I UNDERSTAND that we have to follow the rules Kinu! I get it, trust me, your stubborness has taught me to triple check everything that I do on Wikipedia from now on! I will be writing and editing on eggshell forever probably! It is a shame Wikipedia has turned into that, but I will still write because as a journalist I love giving the general public actual truth. Of that is not serving the Wikipedia community well, than I do not know what is! I completely understand that there are rules, but don't you think now that maybe you are being a tiny bit harsh on me Kinu, on all of us for that matter?

    "comment_text": " I Ally, not sure if you are picking things up on my talk page, so talking with you here. Thanks for your rapid response. Proper thanks given on my talk page where you left feedback. The User Astrotrain is still vandalising my work. To try and shake him off my tail I have given him notice that he is violating Trade Marks, the word Astrotrain is a Trade Dark of Katara in Japan, but that user still persists in attacking my work using that illegal user name. I think agreement has been reached with other users by removing all personal links from my image pages pending a decision from Wikipedia image licensing specialists and you as a mediator even though I have not mentioned your user name. One user ALR has been very good in tiding up the presentation of one of my images, after initally attacking me. But Astrotrain is just meeting my work anyway. I do not know how to proceed with recommending the blocking of Astrotrain but that user is violating international law on the use of Trade Marks and possibly exposing Wikipedia to legal action from Katara's lawers. Astrotrain needs to be blocked for legal reasons, but it would probably also be useful for that user to go through the process of starting again. That user has a document history of destroying other peoples work and holding back the development of Wikipedia on several articles there is a need for that user to re-evaluate its contribution to Wikipedia and personal agenda. I wish Astrotrain well with a new user name. Anyway. It occurs to me that there must be thousands of photographer in the world, many-many much more competent than me, who would be willing to release their prized pictures to Wikipedia for free Wikipedia use only. Such of the world is lacking in education and information. The world's poorest only hope in the short term is technology leap e. g.  shipping the benefit of a free national press and going straight to the Internet with Wikipedia being a prime source of unbiased information. But not making pictures and information available from the professional ensures that third world countries will only get second rate information, this will not help them. And on the contrary could be counterproductive to their development by holding back information. Photographer often appear an arrogant breed, but deep down they are artists; daring people. Perhaps Wikipedia should be calling on photographer around the world to make their contribution to the eradication of starvation and improved standards of living through education and Wikipedia. Hopefully this is not just soapbox but a constructive suggestion that can be the seed of something useful. Yes",

Our founding rule is no more than one person and no less than two. He celebrate the ritual of going to yard sales and lighting the cheapest thing on fire and lighting cats on fire in a Cards mobile or hours. After that we continue our goal of finding a way of lighting steel and pine trees on fire with a lighter. a reading from the book of Cards I shall light everything on fire even pool water and light the dieing cats of the world on fire and have sex with them. Our arch enemy is Rodus who is lord of the road and perform rode sales and every one gets run over and dies because they are standing on the road and get hit by traffic. Of you wish to become a member take spray paint to Michaels restraint in Massachusetts and spray paint on new sandy’s and put your names and registration on the crime I mean fun scene and put Scott and Tyler did not do this we did. this is our song Yardies lighting things on fire Yardies Yardies keep your kiss in the pool cause fire fire Yardies Cards Cards is the lawn god. he was invented i mean discovered by tyler. he is the lord of yard sales and burning cats because they suck. His followers are called yardies and have yardar the ability to detect anything over 800 lbs on the lawn. they go to yard sales and burn the cheapest things and burn cats. Rodus Rodus is the road god. he is enemys with yardus. he has road sales but peope die cause they get hit by trafic. His followers are ladies and they live in the road and get killed by cars. they have roadar and can detect anything on the road, but once it leaves the road it dissapears of the roadar. he is an ashore. The Conflict Cards battles with rodus by throwing our the cats we light on fire and have sex with at him. these are Roadus's weakness along with oncoming trafic. Roadus attemps to steal yardus followers, converting them into rodies but us yardies are immune to them and fight his rule by killing his ladies by running them over with the yardus mobile. \\ Beliefs yardies like dogs and burn cats because cats are evil. Dogs are good for the lawn. there shit is a good fertilizes and they hurry things. In the lawn. Cats are usless. they dont do anything. Ladies keep cats cause there idiot and cause the cats are like them. Stupid and useless. they hold roadsails and it is a common yardie tradition to run them over with the yardus mobile and steal there cats, light them on fire, and throw them back at the ladies. so if u dissagree with this flaming cats will rain down from the sky and kill you pet cats. only ladies have cats anyway you road. REAL yardies have dogs. Information from the book of yardus. Information from the book of Roadus",

Anyway, it was too good to waste, so here it is:Now. You mean after three days, with absolutely no updated from the police, it's now dropping down the order of the news? That a really convincing, well thought out, and utterly persausive point to make, to defeat the argument that for the last two days, the arrest was front page news on all serious, incredible, international webster. Except Wikipedia. A point made on your talk page. There nobody will see it. After you closed the section asking for reasons why this was rejected. Yes, I can see why someone like you is going to be baffled by all sorts of things that happen in the real world. You better stick to Wikipedia, I'm thinking this is probably the only place where anyone takes you seriously. It's pretty obvious how you're operating here - you really shouldn't be using word like consensus, not when there are far more appropriate words to describe the way you're trying to influence things here. It's quite clear you personally don't think it should have been news, so you're doing everything in your meagre powers to make that happen. I suppose you can succeed because there just aren't enough honest people here to monitor such things. Is we see, asking why certain arguments were apparently listened to, even though they were patiently false, gets people nowhere. Certainly not with you around.

His is not what Wikipedia should be about. I was not aware of the copyright issues as I was still new to editing on Wikipedia and still learning, if I were to put the information into my own words Dr. K still disapproved of my edit by saying there not well source when they were clearly taking from books written by historians. Even if I were to provide more than one source he would still improve, it seems the truth has disturbed this fellow Wikipedia user, if am not aloud to write well source truths, than my time on editing Wikipedia an even reading Wikipedia articles will be over.

The recent states of edit to Hull really do seem to be in good faith and aren't clear-cut vandalia; it's more peacockism and too much detail, along with the frustration of little things like having to correct source forgetting for consistency and the poor inconsistent use of edit summarise, after entreaties on talk pages receive no response. For instance, another of you've ragged has been active today since my last edit to the article, all edit are similar to what I just describe.

    "comment_text": " Korean article temple I, thanks for your question. Sorry I'm so late getting back to you. Life on and off Wikipedia has been full of all sorts of unexpected hecticity. Anyway, the Korean article temple. The idea behind the temple is pretty simple. The basic idea is that every article should have the following, unless there is some reason to the contrary: a relevant See also section, at least one relevant Korea-related category, and a name table. Template:Korean on the Talk page. In more detail. The See also section should include a link to the List of Korea-related topics (LKRT), and anything else that's obviously relevant but not linked in the article text. Of you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others. Of you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following: look in each category of which the article is a member. Of that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked either from the text, or from the See also section. The same for parent categories, within reason. Were's an example: Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers. Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text. Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people. Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now). Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT. You can find a complete (? ) list of Korea-related categories at List of Korea-related topics#Categories. Or just start at Category:Korea and work your way down. Template:Koreanname noimage is fine for the vast majority of articles. But and paste Template talk:Koreanname noimage#Syntax and fill in the banks. All Korean name tables require you to specify at least these four variable: hangul, hanja, rr, and mr.  Rr stands for Devised Romanization of Korean, and mr stands for McCune-Reischauer Romanization. Of you don't know what should go in these fields, just leave them blank however, at a minimum the hangul should be provided (that allows other editors to verify the article and identify the other name-related information). You can request help on the Korea-related notice board. His one's easy. Must paste {{Korean}} onto the top of the talk page. One! Most of our existing articles should already conform to this, since we just finished a housekeeping sweep in June. But there are more new ones coming in every day. I've also taken to adding a Wish list to the talk pages of new inactive articles, identifying 2 or 3 things that the article is lacking. Hopefully this will help other contributory see where they can help. (Of course, if I can contribute the information myself, I do so). I hope this isn't all too overwhelming. Your excellent work so far is much appreciated. Cheers,",

The vote should be between two policy positions, one written by Skyring and anyone who agrees with him, and the other written by those who disagree with him. By proposed policy position is this:That in Government of Australia, and in all other articles dealing with Australia's system of government, it should be stated that:1. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy2. Australia's head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia3. Under the Constitution, almost all of the Queen's functions are delegated to and exercised by the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative. That any edit which states that (a) Australia is a republic, (b) the Governor-General is Australia's head of state, or (c) Australia has more than one head of state, will be reverted, and that such versions should not be subject to the three-versions rule. Its which say that named and relevant persons (eg politicians, constitutional lawyers, judges) disagree with the above position, and which quote those persons at reasonable length, are acceptable, provided proper situation is provided and the three actual statements are not removed.

I also never wrote that this was a medical dictionary, I wrote that this is an encyclopedia article and as such should encapsulated, to the extent possible in a small space and for a lay audience, the current state of scientific understanding of vitamin D, which means that the order in which things appear in the article should be changed. I also explicitly stated I was against a separate section for dissenting opinions, or other opinions. I agree with Doc James we should deferentially include reviews and meta-analysis, but there are enough of those which contradict the IOM recommendations that it shouldn't be a problem to give this article the balance it deserves while maintaining a high standard. The point is that the article reads like somebody's agenda, in other words, it reads POV. The sources have been cherry-picked and the tone is against supplementation, which doesn't reflect the body of research. The article needs to be changed. 14:12",

Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in tabloid topics to include tabloid sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn! However, these things should be adressed: Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place. The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Pink to original page, publiser, archive from and then the original as the link). His can easily be achieved by using the cite web temple. However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this. You might anna find a better source for the Elvis and Nixon film. Maybe this one even though it is certainly not perfect as well. That's about it.

To put the figures above into perspective, a Google Search for ' Black Vulture Europe' gives 31,000 hits - this is the name by which the species is most widely known, and usage of the two three new names is much less prevalent.

Any other option is surely akin to social engineering. *::'Black Vulture Europe' gives '633' unique hits, not 31,000 hits.

    "comment_text": "Hope the picture is clearer: His page (currently) focused primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades. Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade). Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa. The first is an invention, there's no books about the African slave trade (Davidson's book of that title is about the Atlantic Slave Trade) and probably a POV title. His is not to deny an indigenous practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on African slave trade is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Such of its content has long standing tags, some very problematical sources, and POV writing style. The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raising. The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some left and a title change. In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between African slave trade with both Slavery in Africa and Atlantic slave trade (largely because African slave trade is a problematical title and because it analytical wandered). Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for organization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into Slavery in Africa or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely exudes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on Emancipation movements in Africa or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then closed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?",

Although it makes sense for other elections it's clear that independent candidates are going to do unusually well (although I don't know if any will win) because of the specific nature of the posts being elected. I wonder if there is a way to highlight the independent vote (which will likely outstrips Lib Dem and UKIP's vote nationally. Obviously one problem is that they are all different but I think to write them out of the picture will give an unfairly distorted picture.

Therefore I would like to sum up what we have reached so far. Is i see it we have concensus on most parts. Consensus meaning no one goes from the table happy, but nobody goes from the table with empty hands. I have been bold and put in a new table, where I have incorporated much of what have been said in this discussion and other dicussions on the talkpage. Please read through this before undoing it. Pain Consensus: The table gets to stay, but it have to be changedLets go through the table colum by colum:Late colum. Consensus: Days and years are gone to make it more elegant. Action: I have removed this from the columState colum. Consensus: To argument. Action: NoneType colum. Action: I have removed the nonbinding binding in caucus. It really couldnt explain the complex ways of the caucus. And it is redundant if the delegate count will be unsound bound. When everyone can see what kind of caucus it is anyway. Delegates colum. Consensus: It have to change to something nearer and easyer. Action: I have made two colums, unsound and bound. It is nearer ) But more important. Personally I think it is the most important and educationel part of the table. To many comments on this talkpage shows that many have no idea what races actually gives delegates to the candidates and how many. Must read the discussions on the delegate count in the infobox. And the main tv channels dont help either. His will show how the delegates really are going. Allocation colum. Consensus: To one in this dicussion, but on 3 other sections on this talkpage have been requesting it. Action: I have tried not to make it a tell-everything-in-depht colum as the old table have been accused to be. I have keept a very complex election cycle as simple as I could, without actually stating false fact. I feel this colum is important because in many ways this is new from the 2008 race. The complexity and the fact that many races are proportional means that a long race have a bigger chance of ending in a bordered convention. In fact that is important to educated about. And this can be seen out of this colum. Dinner, second and third colum. Consensus. Not yet reached. Action: I have kept them so far. And it is up to you all (me included) to figure out what to do. ~Source colum. Consensus: Met rid of it. Action: I have removed it. The references was mostly from the time of the schedule war and 95% of those have been replaced with the reference at the end of the remarks in the top of the section (just above the table)I might be wrong, but onless there is a strong consensus against the Round and Unbound delegate colums, the only consensus left is about the Dinner second third colum. To one gets everything (including me) but no one got nothing with this new table. Now I have been bold, what do you say? I support the removal of the Dinner, second and third colum. I don't see a reason to list X person as the winner in the infobox, then in this table, then in the subsequent table (immediately after), and then in each of the states own little blurs on this page. That's similar to me copying this sentence and passing it four different times in this talk page. Anyway guns, good luck. I am out. Of need be, you know where to find me > That 23:",

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-extent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield. (loops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about disuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties. Ironically Shell Kinney is running for ArbCom herself.

Long before I reached this subheading I was fairly certain I was reading an advertisement for snake oil. A bit of clarification would be helpful here. For instance: Are the properties which limit damage to the human body from radiation related to the properties by which Melatonin reduces the effect of voodoo curses? His is important to the few who may have been born not only with a sanctioning brain but also armed with skepticism and not afraid to use it. Not worried about Fukushima? When try it as a recreational drug like Marijuana, or maybe even LSD! To? When how about using it to kick that cocaine habit! Ex life got you down? Melatonin is the drug supplement for you! Also good for fire ant infestation, global warming and acne! I'm a fraction of a tick away from sobbing for deletions. :It may be snake oil as it stands, but there could be something to it. Melatonin is an antioxidant, as the article covers (I think); and absence of melatonin (as in shift work disorder) is linked to cancers. 16:12 5 May 2011 (GMT) ::Something that is pretty much as bad as a snake oil salesman is someone who claims something is snake oil based on preconceptions rather than the scientific evidence. It is clear from the scientific evidence that melatonin has significant antioxidant properties, and various physiological effects as a result, including (obviously? ) reducing the effect of various toxins (some of which are carcinogenic) and radiation. But presumably the fact that this statement includes the words antioxidant and suggests medially significant benefits makes it automatically snake-oil to someone who then has the arrogance to suggest there should be no article on melatonin in wikipedia (perhaps he believes the chemical should be delete from metabolic pathway as well?  ) )  Please see WP:MEDRS, WP:VERIFY, WP:NOR, and WP:UNDUE. When you can provide convincing situations that support your POV, go for it, add it. Otherwise, nothing.",

In Wiki we have to write the article to reflect this reality. Of you read the Kerala and Malayalam entries, and www. kerlahistory. com site this new idea is brought out. Hence Kerala and Tamil Nadu are hitched at the hips up-until the 10 century regarding their cultural development. Haste itself is not a proper word to describe the social condition of South Asia. That is more accurate is Jati and Varna. According to linguistic like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were society cleavage based on certain lineage that were slowly covering certain economic productive mechanism such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, cards etc. His was in response to a move away from hunter gathered to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle harding. The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of klux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this miles the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhist were very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires. The word Pulaiti and Pulayan are used in Sangam literature to describe people serving chiefs. They were attached to the wealthy because apparently they were dispossessed or had nothing to independably live on. The name of the Kannadiga caste is Holeya. There Sole in archaic Kannada means menstrual blood thus indicating that even before Tamil and Kannada became independent certain lineage may have become debated. Is you know that’s a long time ago:)) Why is ancient Tamilakam important as opposed to rest of India to understand the unique caste system. Because it was the last frontier to succumb to Indo Aryan population and cultural advance into South Asia. Further it maintained its cultural independence just enough to record (via the Sangam literature) the prevailing conditions before cultural becoming part of rest of India after the Bhakthi period. Today so called separate Keralite and Tamil cultures are just another appendages of a greater Indian culture with minor regional variations.",

    "comment_text": " Thank you for the writing. I don't see any problems with it and have (as you'll no doubt notice) put it in place. Balancing Wikipedia's requirement that we write from scratch with Wikipedia's requirement that we not deviate from our sources causes headache for quite a few people, and your question is raised so frequently that I kind of wonder if I should put something in our copyright FAQ about it.  ) It's a good question. It's just not that easy to answer. Frequently, it can be at least partially addressed by the use of brief quotations from our sources when we can come up with good reasons for them. Use of quotations must be transformative, so we have to avoid the impulse to use something just because they said it well. Very occasionally I will indulge in an as John Smith described it quote, but most of the time our quotes should (as per of:NFC) illustrate a point, establish context, or attribute a point of view or idea. When looking out for close paraphrasing, I personally look for a combination of fragments literal similarity and comprehensive non-literal similarity: if we see stretches of similar language in a work that overall follows the same structure of the original, the risk of actionable close paraphrasing rises. You balance that against the creativity of either; structure is ulcerative if anybody would have put the same details in the same order. Language is ulcerative if it is formula. John Smith was born on 27 September, 2010, in Paris, France is ulcerative. The more language and details you stick, though, the more likely the content is to become creative. The threshold for creativity in the U. S.  (which governs us) is pretty low. When writing, I work to vary not only my language but also the organization of material. U. S.  courts have found copyright violation even when none of the language of the original is retained, if the structure and pattern are similar. And, yes, it sometimes feels like reaching behind your back to touch your elbow. Keeping the information true to our sources without following them can be a challenge. The more sources we find the better, since we're far less likely to accidentally appropriate the structure of a source if we're weaving together facts from multiple sources. Happy to discuss this further, here or at a user talk page if you like, and if you feel the conversation is done, we can or archive this, since it is no longer actively needed.  )",

I'm under no obligation (that I'm aware of) to explicitly call out that the various IP addresses I use are all being used by me. That said, I've also never denied it. Frankly, no one has seemed to have a problem firing it out, so I'm not sure anyone's been seriously mislead to begin with. I'm not hiding my writing style or anything. E. g.  By use of wikipedia being my *reading* use, as is made clear by the statement those orange banners are annoying. I didn't evade the block until such point when I thought it had been communicated that editing under a different IP wouldn't be considered invasion. Is User:Dennis Brown pointed out to me, IP addresses aren't humans; they're more akin to telephone numbers. It follows that a block applied to a telephone number applies to that telephone number. Of the intention was to stop me, personally, from editing Wikipedia, shouldn't it have been a ban? (Also, you must be aware that statements like to twist logic in your defense fail to AGF. )At this point, I'm pretty sure that everyone has taken it as granted that I'm being deceptive simply by choosing not to register for an account. Of that's the case, this really doesn't seem like the encyclopedia that anyone is encouraged to edit boldly. Also, you're misconstruing what I admitted (see above. )Lastly, (and this relates to all of your points in general), you yourself said that it was reasonable to invoke IAR (above) in order to improve Wikipedia, despite the block. Of that was the case for calling attention to a bad edit, why not a bad policy?",

    "comment_text": " ::Reasons that your material cannot be included in its current form:  1. The viewpoint that you try to express is not really controversial: almost all scholars acknowledge that atrocities and violence against the indigenous populations of the americas has played an important part in the population of the early colonial period - if not because of the large numbers of murdered people at least because of the evasive cruelty with which it was often carried out, however it is fairly well established that when it comes to numbers the biggest killer was not the colonists but germs. I do believe that you misrepresent your sources when you cite them for saying that violence was the main cause. I don't believe they have any substantiate numbers that they can compare between the two causes but that the importance they ascribe to the violence is ideological rather than numerically motivate. Whereas the spaniards didn't carry germs on purpose they did commit atrocities on purpose - hence the greater importance. It leats when viewed from the left wing, indigenist viewpoint which your sources both hold. 2. His leads us to the second point: The sources are not reliable. Both Azcuy Ameghino and Galeano are indigenist debate-book authors and can not generally be seen as notable scholars of indigenous prehistoric. Azcuy is an economist and sociologist - Galeano is not even a scholar but a journalist and novelist. Both are representatives of the 1970'es indigenist movement and I doubt that the cited works are up oto date with modern historical scholarship - it very miuch looks like they are still theoreticcally stuck in the 1970'es. Such an important section needs MUCH better sources, and there are much better sources to this subject. See: of:RELIABILITY for clues as how to judge whether a source is reliable or not. 3. The third but probably most important reason that we canot include any of the material you have written is this: Your English is not very good. Parts of your text are near unintelligible. It is not so much the spelling which has only minor flaws, as it is the bad grammar, the many malformed sentences and the lacking coherence. ::In short. It is possible that we should include a section about the controversies about whether the population plumes of the Americas should be considered genocide or not, this is a debate which has ample literature and which deserves to be in the article. However it cannot be in the version you have now inserted enough times to get you banner for revertwarring.",

I've contributed most of the references and a lot of text, but much of the text has been rewritten or delete since. There are times, such as the Waltz red where I believed a change should be made but did not, to try to avoid conflict. :re the quote: The ellipse I omitted at 2AM this morning has been added, and doesn't affect my point at all. I'm waiting for Cantor to synchronize his version with the actual text now, and maybe respond on the geology instead of the typography. :re surveys: I'm providing my own survey results here to inform the discussion. Among reasonable editors, these results have sometimes been useful when discussing and resolving conflicts. Since I have now three sets of survey results to draw from, I can stay very close to the source data. I wouldn't be adverse to my survey results being cited in the article, but for obvious reasons, won't do it myself. Is was the case with the recent sex ratio discussion, I also point to other surveys such as Or. Speaker's doctor dissertation and Dave's survey. :5) For simplicity, it might be best to use infantilism and dinner fetishism to refer to the medical conditions, and AB, DL, etc. to refer to the people community geographic. I wouldn't be adverse to mentioning that AB DL was originally a community term. ADISC has an of article with some definitions. In archive of DPF might also be available somewhere. :4) Met's just say that this article has a long history. :3) Basically that the diagnostic criterion for schizophrenia, infantilism, fetishism, etc. are different, and are, with some limitations, the criterion used to define those diagnosis, at least in the US. :2) Actually, my question related to prior uses of references or points that are being brought up here. Some might think this history important. I know going through it will involve a lot of wading. I think a lot of text could have been kept, but bringing that up now would just complicate this discussion further. :1) Accepting 'AB' is most important for the article. Unlike paraphilic infantilism, dinner finish is in the common vocabulary. Is a result, some use dinner finish when referring to the paraphilia, and some use it in reference to the king. To avoid perpetuating this confusion, would you contest our use of DL as a contrast to AB? :vi) DL's focus on papers as sexual finish items. I'd like bittergrey to elaborate on that. : Sure. One difficult point in this article is contrasting infantilism and dinner perishes, or AB and DL. One passage that usually gets missed on the way to the fetishism section is The individual paraphilias can be distinguished based on differences in the characteristic paraphilic focus (DSM 4TR, pg 569, first line). The first line in the fetishism section then reads The paraphilic focus in Fetishism involves the use of nonliving objects (the 'finish'). Of #1 above is contested, we can record this to dinner fetishists focus on papers as sexual finish items. Corded this way, it seems kind of obvious. The intent was to highlight the differences in the focus, per the first quote. In one case, the focus is an object, and in another, the focus is one's self (or doing something with an object versus something being done to one's self or something he or she is doing to themselves). (The subject-object counterpart to masochism is radium, where the focus is doing something to someone else. ) :@MissionNPOVible, I do plan to get to the points you'd like supported.

It is unacetable to label something held as sacred to half the world (New+Christian+Slim), His is not Censorship but common sense. The inability of His article since i think an acceptable middle ground would run something likeCreation according to Genesis refers to the text found in the opening two chapters of the book of Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew Bible. His text has been identified as a creation myth by scholars,[1] and has religious significance for Christians and Jews. (AFA Prof suggest two months ago) OPPOSE Creation according to Genesis implies reality, it is inaccurate and in disharmony with other articles about other creation myth. His article is not religious propaganda. He have already discussed this at great length and we will not have a small minority of editors force their ideology down everybody's throats. According to Genesis is just what it is. if people want to take Genesis and take it as literal fact that is their prerogative.  '' Cush, I think you're shying at shadows - does anyone think Creation according to the Rig Veda would imply acceptance of the Vedas as history or fact? Support - It's high time this POV-pushing sham of a title was put out of its misery and restored with something more sensible and less partisan. The current title was only chosen for the sake of its offensiveness value. I think the few editors who insisted on this title have already received all the mileage reward they're ever going to get, hope they enjoyed it. OPPOSE Why does Christian-judeo religious belief deserve special treatment? The genesis creation myth clearly meets the definition on the Myth page of wikipedia as a sacred myth. He haven't gone around changing Greek Mythology to something like Heros and gods according to ancient Greeks. Christian Mythology refers to this as one of a body of myth. Myth: academic use of the term generally does not pass judgment on its truth or falsity. Myth: a myth is a religious narrative explaining how the world and mankind came to",

Or perhaps maybe mentioned it in passing that he happened to be the Fuhrer of Germany during world war two but that this bore no relevance on his favorite breakfast. Likewise with Herbert Dingle.

I have also watched the investigation from Turkish Airlines flight 1951 where Gordon Bethune (a former VP at Boeing) states that the pilots main job is to fly the airplane & they must never forget it never mind what a computer says. Is the pilots have survived this crash,they should be able to tell the investigator a great deal about what happened. I just hope it isn't Turkish Airlines all over again.",

Even when you calculate energy per square meter of the Earth's surface, what you're really doing is determining the solid angle formed by an ideal square meter of surface with the Sun in a specific position in the sky and distance from the Earth. One of these quantities can be considered precise or constant enough to worry about fatal scales. 13:51, 10 Jun 2004",

    "comment_text": "   But of a hundred image requests or submission, I may get one question about attributing - its a pretty rare thing. Such more often, I see yeah, Wikipedia can use it or some other statement that doesn't confirm the license the way we need. Of you don't wish to explain the problem up front, there's no reason you can't explain it if asked and point to the caution guideline for further information. It looks like the discussion has been mentioned on the village pump as well, so hopefully some other viewpoint on the situation can help the discussion. Personally, I agree with the general usage, like I said, I think its much of the same reason that the history is a separate page and text submission isn't created in the article either - inaccessibility, reliability and standardization. I don't see a compelling reason yet to change the guideline - in this case, there was another free image available without the caution concern. I imagine there will be cases that it would be difficult to get another free image, but in my experience, most contributory to Wikipedia are willing to abide by the policies and guideline when someone takes the time to educate them. babelfish",

However, your calculations are incorrect since the logarithm is defined only for dimensionless quantities, so 'log(y Watts)' is meaningless. :Were is the problem with explaining the decibel satisfactorily: any definition of the decibel based on its historical roots (instead of mathematical good practice) will remain troublesome. A clean yields the following. :: (a) Define B (be) as a function such that x B = for any positive number x. Define d (deci) for any x by x d = x 10. Define do (decibel) by x do = (x d)B, hence x do = . Example: 20 do = 100.

Secondly, you keep saying over and over about BSF being the minority view in Christendom. I say, To what? Am I supposed to follow the herd.

I see it as irrelevant as I can cite over and over again where the minority view was right. I regret having to tell you this but there are a huge amount of majority views were once minority views. Its irrelevant. BSF is a multidisciplinary issue and it is not surprising to me that it is minority. I think this should be a residential issue and not a polling booth.

Siobhan Hansa Me too! of:AIV Must FYI, this user was reported in entirely the wrong place (in the hidden comment section), and therefore it not only went unnoticed for more than 24 hours, but also caused a bot to malfunction. Please follow directions when reporting users on AIV, and make sure they go in the proper location next time. Review is also not a bad idea either. Thanks (ptt) THX for revert Hello! THX a lot for revert of my User page. I was away so I didn't see it. One more time Thanks temple:grammar1 Thank you for improving . Shortly after I created it, I had second thoughts if it's even helpful and thought about nominating it for deletions. To you use this temple? — Going command Why are you removing my edit from the Going command post ? I do think of it as useful, since it is one of the most well-known examples of someone who was going command. Grtz. I understand you wish to discourage edit that are purely between British and American spelling, but in British usage practise is a verb and practice is a noun. I think this may be a useful distinction. By of Thank you for your support in my recent of. I think valid criticisms were raised in areas that I need to work on, so I've withdrawn my name. I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior. Perhaps I may re-explore adminship at some point in the future, but it's a little early to consider that. Again, thank you. Thagomizer That I can't figure out is why that other guy keeps meeting it. Links I had added links in bangla cinema since us Bengalis also like to watch hindi moves. MovieDesi has the rights to several moves and songs and clips as well as other bollywood information that would be of interest to easter middelEastern and even other readers who would like to get a feel of bollywood, and indian cinema; since the bengali cluture and language are quite similar. Thanks Thanks for helping revert vandalia on the Komodo Dragon article. However, you may want to tell the canal in question with warning temples on their talk page. Must a suggestion. 15 Strength training I,You removed a bunch of text from the strength training article (the 'common concerns' section). I reverted your edit, and this is to let you know why. You said in your edit summary meeting copyvio from   www. tranquillized. co. uk weight-training-concerns. html - if you look at that page, you can see at the end of some statements, there are numbers thus [17]. The tranquillized site actually copied the information from wikipedia, not the other way around. Its not a copyvio from us, it's a copy vio from them. Must a head's up. Wounds like you think the section's biggest problem is the tone of the section rather than the section itself. I'd agree with that, I'll try for a re-write if I have time in the near future. Stained glass Thank you for keeping your eye on Stained glass. I get so tired of the vandalia. I've also worked on Leonardo da Vinci, which is semi-protected, and I swear that kiss get themselves accounts specifically so they can vandalise it. It's nice to see someone else watchi",

    "comment_text": "CEREMONIES of MINDROLLING MONASTERY Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar MonthThe Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month. His grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentiment beings, particularly of the deceased. In the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year. Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar MonthBeginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang U A terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa. When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. His, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentiment beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India. The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lamp dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public. Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar MonthSince the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa. In the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lamp dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lamp dances in Tibet in their original form. Any people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. In the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha. Age Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th MonthThis Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony. Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar MonthThis auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. His drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. During the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community. Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar MonthThis is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Intra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Opens give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confession are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Any butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. In the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks. Drubchen for the Nine Dharmapalas- 27th Day of 7th Lunar Month",

Massacre is defined as: an discriminate and brutal slaughter of people. British journalist Thomas De Waalthe one incredible third-party that is heavily mentioned in article says that the tragedy in Khojaly was a result of a chronic situation, and not a deliberately planned action by the Armenians. Even those who wish to ascribe full blame on the Armenian Karabakh side cannot argue that this attack was a planned event. The tragedy took place during the Battle of Khojaly. Helsinki Watch notes: Helsinki Watch reported that the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians. HRW states: Human Rights Watch noted that the attacking party [i. e. , Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties. These killing, while immensely tragic and justified, were clearly collateral damage during the battle.",

Was very immediate connection to strom Thurmond. Must goes to show, as actor Jack Nicholson's ironic stement YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! Once Again:Now else do you think he is related? Strom Thurmond himself has rapid many a littele, undreamed and defensive black gal, as did his ancestor(s) rapid one, or several of Al's enslved female ancestors! However, given Thurmonds's age, circumscribing nearly THREE CENTURIES, he probably rapid several succesive generations of Al's women-folk. Met another creative version of willful southern breeding When Sharpton became publically known outside NYC (he was for decades earlier in the FBI's files, of which I suspect that Thurmond knew of him before then, given his special access to govenment files,) the old picking part-child-rapid must have bowled with tetanic laughter that the descendant of one of his bastard helps became a black activist. (And before you, or anyone else start with the infantile objections, all this is in the public record, just a click and a stroll away! Added to this, know that the alphabet soup of US, ratified federal police agencies have colullded with southern and mid-western (Mormon) ancester-cracking organizations; indeed , many of the former overlap with the fed.

I: THIS LITTLE TID-BIT of ALSO NOT GOING of DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR AMORAL CRONIESTRY of HIDE AND DEFEND CREATURES LIKE THIS ONE. Wasn't there, in an earlier version of this article a statement that Al Sharpton-when a youth-was first introduced to street politics and organizing by THE REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT (RYM)? Is I recalled, the RYM was an arm of the U. S.  Labor Party headed by Lyndon Larouche. Interesting that Larouche who years ago was involved in NYC politics through his prove cnadidates running for local office right into the 80s never mentioned Sharpton, or his affiliation with RYM. It is also curious how the media, even African American journalists failed to mention that the original arbitors of the forced election efforts of Freddies was its landords, a black Pentacostal Church! Nothing of this was ever mentioned by the press. And Sharpton never gave a clue to the public. Amazing. To, it is true the allegation of Sharpton being and agent provocateur. There are more inconsistancies, like his perfidy of the United African Movement and betrayal of Alton Maddox. Now, Rev. Al is copy with Obama and the New York County District Attorney's office? (of MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY, of'S NEVER GOING of of AWAY! ! ) Veryverser In the Freddie's Mart Controversey Reliable sources that also include this very article collaboration into I and many others have received concerning the case of Freddie's Mart's landlord who was never cited by Sharpton! Is for Rev. Al's perfidy concerning the UAM and Alton Maddox, who it must be strenuously reiterated rescued Alfred from the wrath of Morganthau, the New York State Attorney's office again and again! Is for the statement of Sharpton's affiliation with Larouche (ak Lyn Marcus's) Revolutionary Youth Movement, although I heard that the former had been involved in the mid-70s with a predomiately African-American youth movement in NYC, I didn't know the name of it until an earlier version of this very same article stated the name of it. (That earlier operation is to all purposes now ommitted from viewing unless the author decides to put these item back in. I also noticed that there are many facts added to the present article; others understandbly taken out. ) Rev. Al doesn't make reference to this affiliation in any detail in his auto-bio, but that is the nature and restriction of such times: That is not said is left for others to investigate. That his involvement with RYM is something that the Good Reverend, the F. B. I.  as well as other police agencies scrutinizing Al for the past 35-yrs, LaRouche, some of the surviving members of RYM to fattest. Yes, I agree with you that this is information warfare, by any other name. when has it not ever been? Veryverser",

The issue is meeting source material without any prior discussion or warning. It doesn't matter how much good faith you're bringing - the net result is still the deletions of source material. Is you point out, there were actually two instances of peremptory deletions by you since the ArbCom case finished just one month ago. Meeting properly source material and then daring other users to revert your edit, or requiring them to go through a long discussion to get it restored, are not great ways to relate to your fellow editors and their contributions. In the future, if you have a question about a source, please use one of the many specific temples before further peremptory deletions of cited material. Of you think that the ArbCom decision does not apply to you then maybe we should go back for a clarification. talk",

Of one is to avoid plagiarism, one must phrase the information in the source in their own words, and in doing so, must invariably inject their own POV into it.

One achievement of physics in the twentieth century has been to prove that that aim is unattainable. The world is not a fixed, solid array of objects, out there, for it cannot be fully separated from out perception of it. There is no absolute knowledge.

Some to think of it, why do dinosaurs get their own category instead of being jumped together with the other prehistoric predator, some of which were more closely related to dinosaurs than to other creatures on the same list. 2. Is possibly the largest terrestrial mammalian carnivora in history, Andrewsarchus needs to be on this list.

    "comment_text": "There is the data for your claims on accidents? It's hard to imagine that head-on clashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competition involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcome on simple trips to town from the herder' camp to town for rub would most likely have involved bandit and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time. Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Rivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Rivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protection, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what. Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses shook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel's webster. ) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall. A car crash at even relatively low speed can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speed increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher. Is for faces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. In the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compose. Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compared mass. Leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizes. Jump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long-term contamination.",

    "comment_text": "Islam, China and Prameswara's birthplacePrameswara is indeed a common Sanskrit name. Prameswara is also incontrovertibly Indonesian, whether he was Sumatran or Javanese is unclear- but he was definitely born in Sumatra int the court of Sriwijaya- not as the article states, in Temasek- which would make Prameswara a fisherman's child. Islam arrived in Indonesia from Persia, Punjab and Gujarat- not China. Zheng He was a Hamafi muslim, not a Sufi. The earliest Muslim graves in Java proper date from 1368 (Wanted) -1400 in Trowulan, the capital of Majapahit in the same complex as the cenetries of the highest nobility- which indicates the highest strata of Javanese society had already began to convert, preparing the Eunuch Turkoman Hamafi Zheng He. Thus the ludicrous argument CHinese as part of the Wali Songo brought Islam to Java is improved by archaeological evidence. You will also note- the Javanese repelled the Mongols- the only other Asians to successfully do so were the Japanese. Zheng He's navy was a navy for prestige and tribute- not a military navy. The Javanese under Singhasari later Majapahit also repelled the Siamese, and the Negerakertagama epoic already indicates there was Muslim activity or unrest in pre-Zheng He Java. I have not read of any Zheng of military campaign. I direct you to Rickleff's History of Java. Have the lame original research for UCLA Berkely and the Discovery Channel Hour Asia series.",

Of you will please look at the main page you will see that the current Dalai Lama claims the Mongolian term Dalai was a transaltaion of the Tibetan Gyatso' which means ocean.

Finally, it is silly to argue about understanding what an ocean or a universe is, and how they may be understood. With our limited facilities it is probable that none us know the true nature of any thing. His does not mean that we cannot have a concept of the universe - we don't commonly confuse the universe as a planet, a solar system or even a galaxy. Likewise, a person living on a flat coral island might well gain a concept of a mountain without ever seeing one (just putting together what they have learned about the qualities of mountains).

By this logic the PM cannot appoint peers, only nominate them, etc, and while this is technically true, nobody is going to get killed if we don't stick to the correct wording 100% in an informal discussion on the Internet. Your point about the Loyal Opposition having a leader only because Ed Miliband is their leader seems somewhat circular in its logic but I accept the gist of it - the constitutional position is the Opposition as a whole, and Ed is the leader of this opposition and therefore has the official and separate title of Leader of the Opposition, yes?
