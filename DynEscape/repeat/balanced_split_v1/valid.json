You had two problems with the wikitext. First since the reason you provided included an equal sign you needed to add reason= in front of that part. The second was that you had an extra open bracket at the start of one your external links( the one to touch. latimes. com ). To the fixed mark up would be something like: {{subst:Requested move|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus|Her reliable sources since this single article covers two separate devices, but only one of the devices is mentioned in the title.

The ideal thing to do would be to have separate articles for each device, but that logic was rejected. To we need to do the next best thing and include the iPhone 6 Plus in the title of the article, per reliable sources. }} Not sure if their would be much support at this point. Also note that if the article grows long enough and there is enough difference in coverage of the two variations of the iPhone 6 it is possible in the future that the article might get split again, though it is probably too soon to consider that. Is an aside iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sounds a bit wordy, something like the iPhone 6 family or iPhone 6 series might work better; though I personally think that just using iPhone 6 is probably good enough for a title. Anyway hope this helps.",

To Sanchez’s credit, he immediately admitted that all of this was true — although he did judge on the timeline, claiming that his worn and hustling career was over 15 years ago — and denied that escort as with his phone number and photo that appeared three years ago were placed by an impostor. Sanchez valiantly, and painlessly, defended himself on these discrepancies to a kind but unrelenting Alan Colmes on the latter’s radio show. That is anything but a glancing reference. From the MCT: During a radio interview with Fox News Channel’s Alan Colmes last week, Sanchez acknowledged working as a male prostitute, but told Marine Corps Times he hasn’t had homosexual sex since he joined the Corps in 2003. [Zubova: a search of the article does yield a match for prostitute. ]Italics are mine, to aid the reading. Now, we have at least two reliable sources. And note the Phoenix article does not say Sanchez retracted that he was a prostitute, it says he mentioned a few discrepancies when talking to Colmes.

And, while your at it, heed what Keeper has to say above. He's making perfect sense. Keeper, I thank you ;). Now, if you'll excuse me, I have by tomorrow to read over bound states (parity, degenerate and the finite square well potential), eigenfunctions (supposition, completeness, orthogonality and the meaning of the expansion coefficients), hermitian operators, orthonormal sets and deprivation of the expansion coefficients (normalisation of and expectation values in terms of the expansion coefficients), commutators (implication for observations, eigenfunction sets), Ehrenfest's Theorum and the Correspondence Principal.

Flyer22 is correct that your time would be better spent addressing the concerns I listed in the GA review page. Also, about GA reviews, you should not nominate an article for GA review unless: 1) You believe the article is as good as you can get it to be and you have taken care of all the details beforehand, 2) You have the time and are prepared to address all the problems that the reviewed finds. It is true that you can submit an article for GA review multiple times, but to submit an article if you know it will probably fail or still needs a lot of work is a disservice to the GA process as it creates more work for volunteers like me. Of you are not sure if an article is good enough for GA status, you should first ask for a WP:peer review or make a request on a relevant WikiProject (such as WP:WikiProject Sexuality). I hope you use this as a learning process for future articles.",

There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, the we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from Journal Citation Reports). His can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not vigorously peer reviewed & therefore not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication. I'm not sure about this one. Do not think it is one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstract, as is common with many conferences. I would need to check, & I cannot do it this week. But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus. The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. His would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography.  '''''' ( talk )",

Governments are inconsistent as to what information is allowed and when, so there should be some perspective on where censorship was unusually harsh or lax. Some war correspondent are political mouthpiece for a government or a political faction. In example that comes to mind is McArthur landing twice on the Philippines so the camera could get better shots of him. * Sometimes war correspondent act as investigation journalists, but that may not be any more effective, because military organizations are often sheltered from questions they disapprove of. * War correspondent may not be lucky about they see. Richard Tregaskis became huge successful for Guadalcanal Diary, where he was in a very important battleground, but in the Cold War era, less notable happened to him, and his books had less impact and are not well remembered. (There's a war correspondent book called Assignment to Nowhere. Rep.  Must about nothing happened. ) * A small section should mention war correspondent who caused problems, or who, one way or the other, misrepresented the situation (outside of censorship). Examples are the BBC leaking important information in the Falklands, a couple near misses in WWII, and. for example. the Pulitzer Prize winner Eddie Adams, who later felt guilty for a famous photo of a Vietnamese execution that turned out to be other than what he thought. * Some material in the section that was delete, about war correspondent drying themselves up to have a better camera appearance should be brought back, if there is appropriate cited material. One way to proceed would be to quote from published works of the correspondent themselves, when they discuss their job situation.",

By that reckoning, we're all heterosexual white male Christians who love wars of aggression and hate the environment. Capitalist class is capitalists in the aggregate.

It takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do, naturally; the more religious-theocratic the government, the more likely it'll be a full branch of the police or even its own group. Take its inclination in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one. Overall, the fact remains that MANY Islamic nations have religious police of some form or another, and leaving out the fact that it is NOT an institution unique to Saudi Arabia is inaccurate, as is claiming that it only exists in Saudi Arabia and Iran.",

    "comment_text": "Wikipedia:Requests for Comment GoRight Thanks for your kind words about my comments. I'd disagree, though. I'm not convinced that GoRight was, exactly, waiting WMC, he was, more accurately, confronting some clear double standards. The edit which got him blocked for harassment were echoes of what WMC had said, and which had been supported by, as I recall, Schulz. Whether it was true or not, those comments were set up, GoRight just noticed it and said it, violating User:Abd Rule 0. I'd call it civil, but on a scale not worse than what had preceded it, and certainly, because of it's mirror nature, more just. I've tried to reach out to Connolley, but he rejected it, which is sad. I suspect that he's a good man who has fallen into some bad company. (Maybe they are all good men who have fallen into a bad consternation, some pattern that reinforced the worst aspects of the way they are working here. ) The incivility serves no obvious good purpose from any POV except one that would hate the project to be successful, and I'm sure that's not Connolley's POV. In any case, I have not denied the civil aspects of GoRight's edit, I've merely noted that they are easily explainable as a natural response to what clearly appeared to him to be an abusive cabal, and what he was seeing confirmed what was in the Solomon source. I believe that he is now able to see beyond that, and that he's learned to not make accusations that involve assumptions of bad faith. I draw a distinction between noting a reasonable suspicion that something is off, and claiming that it is off. I might note that a user shows characteristics of a block-evening sock, but I won't claim that the user is a block-evening sock unless I'm prepared to back it up with sufficiently solid evidence. I'll only state the former, as well, the suspicion, if the suspicion is clearly reasonable, so I'd just be stating the obvious, which sometimes must be said. And that's how I've treated sock puppet charges against me: if there was some reasonable basis, not matter how shallow, I didn't charge abusive SSP filing. GoRight clearly went too far, but he didn't keep it up. Meanwhile, he was blocked in outrageous violation of block policy, and I'm pulling over whether or not I should do anything about that. Baley has denied that there was any error in the block, and this is what actually might make it necessary to go for an RfC. It's pretty clear, it's not marginal. But, of course, RfC isn't the first step. The first step would be something like what I just did on User talk:William M.  Connolley. The next step, for me, would be to attempt to identify someone Connolley might trust, to give him a friendly judge. Was to be a friend, not merely an ally.",

Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Word to stop blessing this people. Is long as we have evil doers among us, the Word's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. He can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Word to appear and bless us like He would like to. He this a warning. ' (W. S. J. 12 26 95) Jeffs laid the doctrine groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology reaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed. [. Learning for Zion, a hymn by W. S.  Jeffs; 3rd verse]:Imagine the people of Enoch of old, trained in the order of heaven  A beautiful city the Word called his own and forever made his abode  Coming to join with the Zion on earth when finally the earth finds its rest  A kingdom established in celestial laws, a people the Word can accept  A New Jerusalem it will be, a land of refuge, a city of peace [ . .  ]",

By problem with this is that it is not a, up, well known publication, and as such would not likely be reviewed by any newspapers or such. Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need? ) to get my article back on Wikipedia? Now can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a webster to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no webster to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought That better than Wikipedia? Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article? It seemed obvious to me that my description of Tucker and Jason were not in any way insulting, as their apparent lack of intelligence is a character trait. Thanks in advance for your response.",

His is not an alternate person, this is me talking the way I talk, trying to resolve an issue with another user the way I would do normally, a user I have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing. In this case however, for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to reign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins, I just don't happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because I happened to have decided to try and do that. ErrantX, if you want to continue to smear my actions in the most despicable way, by trying to paint what were civil, polite queried, as a pursuit, and you want to continue to insult me by insinuating I'm a coward, then I guess there's nothing I can do stop you given you've been entrusted with the power to do so. But I'll take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of of:SOCK I have actually violated, or indeed identify which part of of:HARASS I am supposedly guilty of, as evidence that you can't. Not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that Malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation, or had asked me to leave and I had refused to do so. I guess you two can live with that I suppose, but mark my words, if or when there's an arbitration case concerning Malleus' conduct, then I'll be entering this experience into evidence, and adding User:ErrantX and User:Bwilkins as admin parties to it, with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user, who neither requested the communication to stop, or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way. I did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if Malleus was willing, given that there's some simple concluding statements that arise from it that I'd have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not, but I get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some serious reason, whether he was interested in doing so or not. I sincerely hope there's nothing deeper than simple admin over-reaching going on here, but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes. I'm sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like AGF, indeed the steps outlined in policy. To, you just content yourselves that you've done something good here, and I'll just get back to my main account and do my thing there, and we'll see what the future holds for all of us.

It should be linked to Wikipedia:Policy thinktank (that may be a category thing now. haven't proposed anything in ages).

Althouth in some cases there may be a transgender proclivity in some who take advantage of this opportunity to switch gender roles in general, it is an sexual society position: all sexual expression is forlorn, operational entering the participants.

Two of these changes, however, were incorrect. 1.  the underground river (name: Saint Vincent) enters La Verna chamber from the EAST not the WEST! 2. I quote the president of the ARSIP, Michel DOUAT, whom I know personally:je te confirme que le cumul du développement de 1471 cavités rescencées sous le massif de la Pierre Saint Martin est bien de 437 km au 01 04 2015. Les 148 km sont des données anciennes relevées sur la synthèse éditée chaque année (235 km en 2014). Or, cette donnée représente uniquement les topographies numérisées reportées sur la synthèse. Les topographies anciennes ne figurent pas dans cette donnée (par exemple la Pierre et le Lonné Peyret). Les topographies de la multitude de petite cavités non plus. Ll faut donc préciser que les 437 km sont le cumul du développement de toutes les cavités du massif de la PSM. He te joins une copie d'écran des statistiques de la base de données ARSIP. Tu constate que les 10 cavités les plus importantes représentent déjà un développement de 261 km (83 pour le seul rameau PSM - Partages).

All this information can be found and verified by contracting the ARSIP - Association de Recherche Spéléologique Internationale de la Pierre Saint Martin.",

    "comment_text": " well, I saw that I'm appreciate by you , do not worry about me, mister PaleCloudedWhite (it is funny for me WhiteCloud-NubeBlanca an indian character in a old Hollywood movie). I am not resentful about anything, not matter, I'm Spaniard these days I'm watching moves and very bussy with my first trip to U. K. , and I'm preparing a trip to Tarragona too, and another to Huesca. I hope you will don't forget the botany. Wikedia don't pay me money, you know it, It is just for help people. S. M. P.  could upset, but she is very bussy these days and besides. Well, mister, please don't quit botany. I hope you will write about it. I don't need to have any user account to write here. There is much work to do and it takes time. I can tell you that I use several books as ANIMALI Some sono. One vivono. Some vivono from an italian Edizioni Labor-Milano by a group with G.  Scortecci, director del instituto de la Universidad de Génova (Chenoa) translated in 1960 to spanish by Vergara Editorial. To, I translated from spanish to english a text of italian origen. I prefer mostly fishes anphibians and wizards, in this order. But as you know I used to write too, about plants that are totally unknown for me. I hope in future to visit the Mamut cases in Kentucky and see the blind fishes. He use to create new pages with an account because it is requested by Wikipedia. I wish best regards for Nadiatalent-Sminthopsis84 she must be very young. I cannot speak about S. M. P.  this is internet, you know, she is not writing long time ago, but it is not important neither. I would like that you can try people will write about botany, other Wikipedias have more information. I know that there are other web with botany topics, but Wikipedia allows to jump between pages. Well, I must watch my moves, and write my homework. You can visit   www. fotolog. com  if you like about the song. I love basque girls. You could visit Donosti beach Playa de la Concha, en San Sebastian, I hope speak you in the future, and I hope your help too. The articles are best with you and other people writing it. I would like write to Nadiatalent-ST84, but she has forbidden me, and S. M. P.  could read about it too. Well a hug for you, mister P. C. W.  (Ran jeff NubeBlanca) from me: C. C.  Best regards! — Preceding signed comment added by  Most Scriptum: There are few photo about tropical plant genera, even there are not any photo about some tropical families, please, looking for at least 1 photo for every family of plants, and every genera. There are plenty of photo about species of hers very likely. P. S. 2 — sorry, again, these nicknamed are funny to me P. C. W.  sounds me the first time Paleo White Cloud old white cloud- Paleo white cloud- Paleo nube- Paleo nube blanca. Nadiatalent sounds like nadietalent-without talent- nobodytalent- ningún talento- estalentao- silly. Sminthopsis84 sounds us as Mint thopsis, but thopsis remind me Being boxes without topsessandals were for Clementine. Mint Topses from the Clementine song. (what is a topse? ? ) every thing was too much funny. I imagined to P. C. W.  as an old chief indian with a very long white beard, as a Sant Claus with feathers, and NT as a slavian Calamity Jane with bad temper, mind-skirt, long legs, Mint fragance and blueyes. I must say that I love this type of girls. I did an effort trying to be serious, but I thought what a crazy people I don't want annoy anyone, and I prefer to be polite with people with a hysterical behaviour, I repeat , I prefer to be silent,to be quiet with crazy people. I never wanted annoy anyone. I want apologize with every people if I did they feel bad. C. C.  P. S. 3- S. M. P.  dislikes when I speak some women, mostly good looking ones as: Sarah Stierch, even if they live in the other corner of the world.",
