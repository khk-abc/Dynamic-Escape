Specifically, I take issue with the entire Differences between the 800 and 850 series section, because I contend that there is no such thing as a T-850. Stan Winston Studios, which designed the terminations for the films, confirmed this to me via e-mail when I wrote to them asking their opinion. Their response (direct quote): I'm not sure where the T-850 came from. Is far as I know, Arnold's Terminator has and always will be the T-800, model 101. Now, the root Terminators in T3 are Of's and Kristana Loken is the TX. I hope that clears it up. While the term T-850 is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.

You used a good quote which shows it's lack of credibility for showing racial size differences (this is already noted in wiki article). But the same is true of the Jakinworld survey. The sample size of Africans was too low to be of use (1. 7%). To I would say both the sizesurvey. com survey and the Jakinworld survey are lacking in credibility for comparing racial sizes. I'd say we should either have both in the article (for fairness and neutrality) as weak anecdotes evidence or not have either. It is questionable. Coolnurse. com doesn't even know where the survey information came from. Interesting read, but not incredible. Of better studies and surveys are done that conclusively show black people are larger on average as a whole (race), then yes, that should be published whether diet or god gave it to them. Is of now, studies show too many discrepancies to make any conclusion. K.  That was a bit of a mind-tender to all contemplate. I think I need to take a break from this article. Penis Penis Penis.

There is another benefits of that today financial companies are not providing loans in negative areas but after UID may possible they can provide loan in negative area because bank will easily get the details of defaulters & common man will really get the benefits of UID.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) (Hindi: भारतीय विशिष्ट पहचान प्राधिकरण), is an agency of the Government of India responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card or Unique Identification card (UID Card) project in India.

[14][45] Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca by the Aksumite king Abraha who supplemented his army with elephants.

After the Gibraltarpedia controversy broke last month, existing Gibraltar-related DYK nomination were put on hold while a discussion took place on option for dealing with them and with future nomination. Undress did not participate in that discussion. Its outcome is summarised in the box at Wikipedia talk:Did you know GibraltarPediA Nations. There was nearly unanimous agreement that DYKs should go forward, as long as they met the DYK requirements and that any COI promotion aspects were explicitly addressed by reviews. A temporary requirement for a second reviewed was also added to ensure improved scrutiny of the nomination. Is a result of the brief moratorium, a backing built up of articles that had temporarily been held back from the Main Page. His backing has now almost entirely been cleared. There has been no suggestion that any specific article should not have run because of being promotion. Undress is wrong to claim that there was an agreement to run one a day. In fact there was no consensus on this suggestion. There are further articles now in the nomination queue, awaiting review, but there is no reason to suppose that they will appear at the same frequency. I anticipate that they will appear over the course of several weeks. Met's be clear: Undress is taking an extreme position that any article on any topic relating to Gibraltar is promotion and should not be allowed, even if it passes every DYK criterion and even if there is no conceivable promotion aspect. (Cases in point: Gibraltar Cross of Sacrifice, a war memorial; Trafalgar Cemetery, a disuse historic graveyard; Moorish Gibraltar, a history of Gibraltar from 711 to 1462). His position has been rejected by the vast majority of people who have commented on this issue. He cities out-of-context quotes from a YouTube video while ignoring the fact that nobody is directing the development of these articles - people are simply writing about things that interest them, whether or not they have any promotion value. He ignores the fact that specific topics have often been the subject of frequent coverage on DYK. Recent examples have included the Olympics and Paralympics, racehorses (120 DYKs), Indonesia (300 DYKs in the last year), mushrooms, Bach cantatas and so on. In absolute terms these have had a far greater amount of coverage and higher frequencies. In short, Undress is singing out one topic area and numerous good-faith contributory who have written articles of undisputed high quality, on the basis of what a couple of people, who are not writing or directing articles, have said about it.

His has an evident explanation in East Germany, but the same happened in the West, despite the fact that it could have been a handy Cold War propaganda tool *Still the rape story lived on, both in personal communication, and numerous in novel and film, as well as in gov't documents.

That's it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are? ” describes your actions as “roofless accusations of vandalia in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article police state don't even pass the straight face test. ” even took the time to write a letter to the administrators about your behavior. Dear Administrators:I would like to file a complaint against user nescio for wanton vandalia of the article entitled Police State. User Nescio has been meeting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e. g.  historical police state examples  Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, as well as other examples . His childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a latent misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail. Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. Sincerely yours,User Winston Smith describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior. ” had his warnings to you about harassment delete and reported you as a canal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings. has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to invite an edit war. is continuing to remove edit and warnings of mine from his talk page while falsely accusing me of talking and sock puppet. I have to say that Nescio and others had understandable grounds on which to suspect you of sockpuppetry. Act is, you appeared on scene the day of shortly after three genuine sockpuppets appeared, and you shared the same POV and short history of editing. Please explain what makes you think that is a sockpuppet? An you cite these actions of VinnyCee that are considered to be those of a sock-puppet? I just did. It turns out that Vinny Cee is not a sockpuppet (at least, of anything we checked), but there was good reason to suspect she was. To VinnyCee is not'' a sock puppet. His means that Nescio's accusation of him being a sock puppet is false. Did you check into whether the other accusations made by Nescio against other users are also false? I would bet that they are. It seems that you grass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. His is against WP:NPOV policy. Please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken.",

I had to cry for days, I was ignored, made fun of and insulted. what did my mother do? she didn't force me to be a catholic like my father tryed to do, but she didn't help me either, she just seemed to agree with him, while agreeing with me when he wasn't there. just like an evil cat. and she does just that all the time, she complains about my father's obssesive controlling personality with me and my sister, but when my father says all his bullshit to me she never says a thing, but it's different with my sister(16) because my mother supports her against my fathers crazy temperament. my father treats me like I'm a 30 year old drug adduct living off his money. he doesn't get that I'm studying a career and that(like everyone here, I funny about other countrys) he has to pay for it. it's not like I'm not doing anything! my 'god'. whenever I'm happy what do they do? I swear to my life that they FUCK THINGS of FOR of no matter what. and whenever I'm sad (that's most of the time arround them, because I don't dare to even joke arround with them since they are offended by anything) whenever I'm sad they come with theyr you need god in your life bullshit. or theyr see? we are right and u r wrong bullshit. I'm sick of this, I just anna get a fucking job, get out of this house and lead a NORMAL LIFE where I'm not issolated from my friends and can go out and have fun with them without being threatened with looking the internet conection or being taken out of college. and my sister? according to my friends who kind of know my situation. she's envious of me and that's why she treats me like shit and doesn't even respect my room like I do hers. and can you believe I love them? I do , and that's why I think Am looked, because this isn't possible. I forgive them every single time! but Of I want to hold on to my physical and mental health and have somwehat of a good future, I have to develop a stiff upper lip and not give a shit about them anymore. and I should even take regenge according to most of my friends! but I don't even want to! I just anna be left alone anf try to forget all I've been through. I just wish it was physical abusse so I could show my scars and make a point, but this way. anyone can think I'm crazy. Maybe this is the cause of all my existential doubts, because I don't have anything to be sure of and feel confident about in my everyday life becase my family does the job of ruining everything for me. I'm sorry for all the swear words, but I had to express how I felt somewhere, also I think I'll ease this because I don't think it's allowed at all on wikipedia, it's just that there's so much rational people here that I think I can get some good advice and I've nowhere else to turn.",

You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the ones has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do. One of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. His does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e. g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( 'Suna times' and 'Waamo news'). To, there are not multiple images on Godane, there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won't make the other various portraits vanish. His still dose't help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. His source here, is the only thing that you have showed me which highlight that the image may not be Godane. I bet you're smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have prove the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. His source is meager. It is reliable as it is questionable. The article is a blow, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it's riddle with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e. g (Hammami is still advocating for Robow’s troopss. ) Are you bidding me? The author can't even spell, and you're taking this blow over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U. S State Department. Now is all I can say. Furthermore, the blow doesn't identity which picture is incorrect (Of indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cities his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn't help, as the author hasn't established where he got his information from concerning this supposed 'incorrect' image of Godane. Again, you're going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point. The basis that 'foreign media agencies' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. His geographical argument is meaningless. K then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well!  ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not 'based'? Mmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. That you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that's Somalia or Timbuktu. His source for example from BBC is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporter, correspondent, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source. The Somalian media are going to be no more accurate than BBC Africa , as they will not have the extensive resources that the BBC have, even in Somalia but also elsewhere. And finally, this. the various portraits can perhaps go in the body as StantheMan87 suggested  -. To now you're willing to compromise? The, I see!

Or perhaps not. Were's a tibia from that last WS Trivia section linked above: According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th winning of Game 6, was not stadium trained. (8th item down the list)I don't think you can top (or is it bottom? ) that for trivial. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivial sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minute onto these pages and file them under Trivia and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . later. Part of my motivation for dressing up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant into in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say Fall Classic Portal? ). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivial about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the Background section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to soft through it and move the into. Putting to the chase: All this WS Trivia is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivial, so if a handful of labels could be cooked up for categories of into formerly known as trivial, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivial issue. Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contended splints on the road and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. That the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what of (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thou past Fall Classic to see when else this happened, so I can add this into to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this into each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot tends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted of writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really 'nuff said. (talk)",

Or eprhaps not. Were's a itbia from that last WS rTivia section linked aboev: According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined pu in the field during hte 9th winning of Game 6, was not stadium trained. (8th item down the list)I odn't think oyu can top (or is it bottom? ) that for trivial. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivial sections (and probably more) have piled pu ni these Wordl Sereis raticles: Wirting well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply dorp minute onto htese pages and file tehm nuder Trivia and elt somebody esle do teh hard work fo integraitng them . later. Part of ym motivation fro dressign pu all those links aobve is that I've notiecd an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confsuing or redundant into in all the WS articels giong back to 1903. It's like the same car buitl by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find ti a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybdoy to have developed a plan for what could eb a real highlight of WP (can oyu say Fall Classic Portal? ). I found it fairly easy to tkae teh '06 trivial about aL Russa and Leyland and create a sepaarte sectino under the Backgorund section, adn it seems ot have held pu sinec Friday night. uBt it took some time ot soft thorugh ti adn move the into. Putting to teh hcase: All this WS Trivia si classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivial, so if a handful of labels could eb cooked pu for categories fo into formerly knwon as trivial, the overall style fo these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivial issue. Postscript: oFr instance, a 4-1 WS where one contended splints on the road and hten comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clnich is fairly rare from hwat I'ev looked pu so far. That the Cards ahve done against Detroit in 2006 matches what of (LN) acocmplished in 1969 (ecxept the Mtes dropped Gmae 1 insteda fo 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working ym way thou past Fall Classic to see when else tihs happened, so I can add this into to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might eb appropriate for this into each and every year: Long series, hsort series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short sreies, 6 or 7 classifeid as long. Easy to psot tedns ni this area adn develop copy to fill a section like this. aWs a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a ternd brokne, were the prognosticators wrong, ddi a noted of writer ponit this out so it doesn't samck of the dreaded Original Research?

I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalist, it was backwards, and most of its populace was educated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communist the reasons were nationalist or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right.

I merely wanted to illuminate the social and political context of the ownership of these weapons and in part explain why ownership of these civilian variant is comparatively rare outside of the United States of America. Instead, I created the appearance of political bias. I should have remembered that some other readers find international standards and opinion to be very relevant to domestic law. Thus the second statement could be perceived as making a political argument in favor of prohibiting these weapons. That I should have done is simply note that most countries around the world prohibit or heavily restict ownership of these kinds of weapons but that they are legal in most states in the United States which means that the ownership of civilian Kalashnikov variant is largely restricted to the United States. That would have provided the correct political and social background, could have easily been source and would have avoided making an supported statement easily misinterpreted as politically favoring one side or the other through no fault of the reader.",

(Especially since the current More Recent Theory section describes developments that are 50 years old! ! ) It's gone from virtually nothing nonplanar 10 years ago (aside from small perturbation around plantar cases, or even crude uncontrolled heuristic formula), to the first cylinder-plate calculation 4 years ago (by Emig, Kardar, Jaffe, et al), to application of advanced computational methods from classical of in order to compute Casimir forces for essentially any geometry demonstrated in the last 2-3 years. There are a couple of ways to look at it. First, once you express the unknowns approximately (to any desired accuracy) in a finite basis, the complicated functional path integral can be turned into log determinants, and the matrix you are taking the log determining of is essentially a classical scattering matrix of some sort. Second, one can instead think about evaluation the mean fluctuation of the fields via the fluctuation dissipation there, which re-expresses the correlation functions in terms of classical Green's functions (fields from currents) that can be solved by standard classical methods. (The two approaches turn out to be mathematically equivalent in the end, and are also equivalent to humming frequencies all Casimir. ) The main wrinkle from the point of view of classical of calculations is that it turns out that you need in practice to evaluate the scattering problem at imaginary or complex frequencies (where the problem becomes much nicer numerically and analytical), and you need to solve many classical problems for a single Casimir problem. There is a new book on Casimir Physics coming out (in the Lecture Notes in Physics series) on the subject of recent Casimir developments. I was invited to contribute a chapter on numerical methods, and I've posted a preprint of my review article (accepted, in press) on arXiv arXiv:1007. 0996. His might make a useful reference for the Wikipedia article (although I can understand if you want to wait until the book comes out in print), or in any case the references contained therein (see e. g.  the references at the top of page 2) should give an idea of the scope of the recent developments.

Last year, 19 points secured a place; before that, 11 (2012) or 8 (2011) were enough. His is both a blessing and a curse. While it shows the vigourous good health of the competition, it also means that we have already lost many worthy competitors. Our top three scores were:, a WikiCup newcomer whose high-quality scars of rare banknotes represent an unusual, interesting and valuable contribution to Wikipedia. Most of Godot's points this round have come from a large set of pictures used in Treasury Note (1890–91). , a WikiCup veteran and a finalist last year, Adam is also a features picture specialist, rousing on the restoration of historical images. His month's promotions have included a carefully restored set of artist William Russell Flint's work. , another WikiCup newcomer. WikiRedactor has claimed points for good article reviews and good articles relating to pop music, many of which were awarded bonus points. Articles include Sky Ferreira, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus and Wrecking All (Miley Cyrus song). Other competitors of note include:, who helped take Thirty Lights of Moving through good article candidates and features article candidates, claiming the first first features article of the competition. , who claimed the first features list of the competition with Natalia Kills discography. , who takes the title of the contributory awarded the highest bonus point multiplied (resulting in the highest scoring article) of the competition so far. Her high-importance salamander, now a good article, scored 108 points. After such a competitive first round, expect the second round to also be fiercely fought.

He is not mentioned at all in the Portugese language article but, unfortunately, that is little more than a sub so his omission means little. Should he really be listed in the into box? Of so Is there enough information on him in the Naval battle at Mormugão harbour section to create a sub article on him?",

CWC(talk)   en. wikipedia. org wiki User:Chris_ChittleboroughI suffer from Bipolar Disorder Type II (a Had Thing) with an odd twist: I have never been Manic (which is a very Good Thing). I repeat, Wikipedia must use universal terms that are backed up by reliable sources. Wikipedia is not just for residents of one city or one country. I have demonstrated that your edit doesn't conform to Wikipedia policy, and have provided liks to several Wikipedia articles showing why your edit is incorrect. You have not demonstrated that your edit is justified. In response to your incorrect assessment of the situation of the Neo-Nazism article, clearly do not understand what that dispute was about, and why my edit were 100 percent justified and followed Wikipedia guideline, unlike the edit by the people who disputed my corrections. Finally, in response to your last comment, I will post the following Wikipedia temple and suggest that you read up on Wikipedia guideline: .",

This occurs is (1 22) cases. (1)*(1 22)=(1 22)Of you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:(20 21)*(19 20)*(18 19). *(2 3). This can be re-written as:(2*((20! )*(1! ))) (21! ). There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1 2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21! ), you must divide by (21! ) (2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. of, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics reaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (methods writing a planet) or artificially (satellites writing Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventional call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'. That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or precise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction. Met me explain what I mean with my intuitiveness concern by using the following example: When a kid spine a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity following the same rational, when you lift a suitcase you apply antigravity to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's beating some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to beat as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. Of you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuition level with centripetal centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confused the reader (then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right. . ) and s he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formula.",

One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one. His time I will not respond to the insults posted by User:Makedonas, User:Restore and User:Vergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Must to quote the last comment by User:Makedonas: His is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)! For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this. History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks! Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc. For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population. Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia. Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century. Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airport, streets etc got the Macedonian name. To, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)! One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there. Any of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes. Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc. Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! To far, Belgium never disputed that. In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressive disputes the right of our country to use its name. Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.",

Serbs were a double folk who, essentially, didn't fight their place under the sun. Their very name dignified servitude of a sort, as evidenced by the DAI's etiology. They lost every battle with foreigners they ever fought, placed themselves under Byzantine suzerainty amd were saved from extinction by Croats who crushed Bulgarian aggression3. there are historical documents galere, which testify about Croatian legal, parliamentary and cultural continuity: from the times of Trpimir and Krešimir to the later corpora. 4. Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attended in from the 13th century on (at least). They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. In the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Heroism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and connection. 5.  early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al. ) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage. 6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years. Virtually all Starčević's claims are corroborate by historical sources available at his times. Whether the velocity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starčević polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortion, lies or misappropriations. Sarcasm hurts-but, this is what the polemic is all about.",

I believe that the grid is physically correct but the image of the CMBR on the left as a surface (rather than as a circle) and the representation of stars as points rather than geodesics, are simply artist concepts and readers should be warned. Any objection against pointing out the ambiguity of an image from a qualified source? To you believe they are really correct? (Image copied here for easier reference) I have mixed feelings. In the one hand it's one of those pictures that's pretty but doesn't do a great job of illustrating the actual science. In the other hand it could do a lot worse. I'm still trying to figure out what the scale (radius of the circular cross-sections) is supposed to represent. It's not the FRW scale factor because then the inflationary epoch and the CMB would be invisible (smaller than a fixed). When I thought it was the comoving radius of the observance universe, but then it shouldn't flare outward on the right or have that point on the left (the graph of the comoving radius can only be concave upward if the universe is shrinking). Maybe it's the scale factor with a significant amount of distortion to make the early ears visible, but then the Inflation label is pointing to the wrong place—it should be pointing basically where Quantum Fluctuations is pointing. Or it could be the log of the scale factor, but that has the same problems as the comoving radius. The illustration of the evolution of the salaries is kind of cool, and could perhaps be justified by saying that they took slices of the universe of nonzero thickness at intervals of, say, 100 million years and stacked those on top of each other. That would explain the lack of continuous world lines. Are people going to get that? I don't know. [[Mile:Big_bang_manifold. png|right",

For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. For do academic have a monopoly on logical or actual correctness, scholar integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academic themselves (and of course, their aspirin apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflated their academic robbery to blimpish proportions). Byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. His is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertion. However, this is a bit spacious, for having belated come to the realization that he has no relevant, veritable assertion to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertion of others. Thus, we now find him impetuously and rather nominally demanding that every one of Langan's assertion receive a separate situation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertion are made is already directly linked to the article. It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate situation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be prove false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of purification without verifying anything himself. By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any situations or other sources of purification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cities, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news network. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. His consolation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, side remarks, and self-righteous, actually worthless criticism. but not one relevant situation in hand! Nothing he says is veritable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert.

There are other important policies and guideline. For example, there's of:Consensus, and of:Summary style, and of:Undue weight to name a few. Must because some inserted material satisfies of:NPOV, of:V, of:of, and of:NOR does not mean that an editor can insist (repeatedly) on inserting it into an article. And whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus. Ferrylodge, I certainly accept that other policies may apply. And I know you are acting in good faith with good intentions. But with all due respect, I think your message muddles the waters. First of all, undue weight is a subjection of NPOV. By my linking NPOV, I simultaneously included undue weight. The difference is, I made it clear that NPOV is the umbrella policy and undue weight is just a component of that policy and has to be interpreted in the context of the policy as a whole. You took it out of context which could mislead some people. Also, Summary style is not a policy. I was talking primarily about policies. Summary style is a guideline and it may be useful to editors but it does not have the force of a policy. Finally, I agree with you about consensus, but the consensus policy addresses a different issue than I was raising. By point was about what can go into articles. Consensus says nothing about what can or cannot go into articles. The consensus policy is about interpersonal behavior and process. The consensus policy is not about content; NPOV, V, and NOR are about content. It is NPOV, V, and NOR that determine what is acceptable and unacceptable content. The consensus policy lays out a process for resolving conflicts over content. But it does not establish principles for resolving the conflict. The principles remain NPOV, V and NOR. When editors get into a conflict, we should consult of:CONSENSUS for ideas about how we can better work together. But before consensus-based editing, the first step to working together is agreeing to abide by the content policies, NPOV, NOR, and V.  | Talk I agree that whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus, but consensus does not mean unanimity (according to the policy), it is a process of collaboration. And to participate in this process everyone has to agree that if content is a notable significant and veritable view from a reliable source it will go in even if I do not like it, if they cannot say this, and mean it, they are not participating in a consensus process. And some people above have argued that content should not go in even if it is notable, veritable, and from a reliable source.

However, I appreciate that you are open for a civil discussion, which is not as frequent nowadays as it should be. To, let's go (on my side not in native English, and I ask for your patience if the same could be said briefer). Your first impression could have been that my adding the word controversial after the and in the subtle Environmental and human rights activist can be bias, as certain Wikipedia guideline generally suggest about this word. Generally it may be true, but not if, as in this case, the paragraph itself actually speaks about the Gaarder controversy, and it opens to a whole session about that controversy. Must the other way around; actually the existing title was a bias: because all the Journalistic Ethics Guideline I've ever seen, state that titles should express more or less what is written within the article, and can't say the opposite. (Which, unfortunately, is a not unfrequently used way of bias; utilizing that much more people read the title than the whole paragraph, and the title remains in the minds, while the truth-qualifying statement somewhere inside the article runs unnoticed). Now can the title be simply about his human rights activist when there is a controversion mentioned in the article about his hate-speech against a whole nation and a religion? I don't suggest that the Wikipedia article condemn Jostein Gaarder, as I learned and think now he has fully deserved, but 'controversial' his human rights activity certainly is. Therefore I firmly believe that you should revert my edit: I added in the title the word controversial, as the paragraph itself proves it expressedly, in order to make it: Environmental and controversial human rights activist. Also, for balance, besides Gaarder's own views of his own op-ed, I added at the end, how some others see the case: 'But some others see this op-ed as an expressedly anti-Semitic document' Bthw, about the whole Gaarder controversy subject in this Wikipedia article it feels strongly that the Gaarder side - for which it is a central issue - denied it rather succesfully as if almost only the Norwegian Jews found his op-ed offending the Jews and Judaism. In fact several serious works of others (see later) also condemned Gaarder's op-ed as terrible hate-speech. At least one more change - addition - is required: where the Gaarder controversy session writes about others, it asks in blue [Who? ] and I wanted to add there the best source I know (The Augean Tables webster), but it seemed as if I was blocked to do so. To, if, as I suppose, you are sincerely interested to learn about the controversy, read: 'Open Letter to Jostein Gaarder: Risking Crypto-Supersessionism' on   www. theaugeanstables. com multiple-part-essays open-letter-to-jostein-gaarder-fisking-crypto-supersessionism  . His is a scholar answer to Gaarder's every statement by an American historian, and it gives every chance to Gaarder to correct himself in a respectful way. That Gaarder has never done,he only said some vague self-justifications like 'it was written in a haste' and 'should have been worded more cautiously - as if these could justify vehement hate speech by an authority. Is a summary, my edit is a very mild correction only to Wikipedia's Jostein Gaarder article, relative to the hate-speech he committed against a whole people and a religion, and has never corrected.

It is true that Islamic dietary restrictions, like those of Judaism, forbid the eating or handling of pork because pigs are considered unclean. But according to Raeed Tayeh of the American Muslim Association in North America, the notion that a Muslim would be denied entrance to heaven for touching a pig is ridiculous. A statement from the Anti-Defamation League characterized the claim as an offensive caricature of Muslim beliefs. In other words, it's just an urban myth, though probably we might want to put it on as an Urban Myth",

Father than trying to define legitimate violence, Kossler speaks of the public dimension of violence. Kossler also sees an economic dimension: The guarantee of sound market conditions therefore is also dependent on the effective exercise of sovereignty by the state. After covering the classic position, Kossler points out that non-state actors mess it up: The post-9 11 situation forces important and disconcerting qualifications on this rather conventional picture. His goes back to the fact that an act of outrageous violence emanating from a non-state source which cannot be defined in territorial terms has been interpreted as an act of war, to be countered by military means, including the marketing of certain state-bounded territories, such as Afghanistan and later Iraq. He also mentions the rise of network organizations, including crime carters that operate across borders, as challenging state monopolies on violence. In 2004, George Will wrote, about the US-Iraq war, The first task of the occupation remains the first task of government: to establish a monopoly on violence. Because that effort wasn't successful, there's a lot of later material on what happens when the state can't establish a monopoly on violence. See also Arab Spring.

All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedia content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. His policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it. Currently, the article is heavily based towards a historical heritage representation of Paris. The article is structures the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn't been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV. Acts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today's Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generation the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructure, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airport, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe. To know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructure aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ).

It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. That kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology? Any regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liar and the lies they tell include the top media cover-up. They cover up many historic photo of the Pledge of Allegiance   rexcurry. net pledge2. html that reveal its original straight-arm salute. They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and short (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the Nationalism movement, the Nationalist magazine, the Nationalist Educational Association, their dogma of military socialism, and Edward inspired the Nationalist Party. They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin   rexcurry. net pledge1. html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Is part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth   rexcurry. net pledgesalute. html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome. They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at   rexcurry. html and at   rexcurry. net pledge_military. html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute   rexcurry. net book1a1contents-pledge. html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).

Wikipedia's liar cover up for the swastika   rexcurry. net swastikanews. html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liar cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party   rexcurry. net swastikamedia. html by verse of the hackneyed shorthand Nazi. Any Wikipedia posters are liar in that there was no Nazi Party because it was actually the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the party members did not call themselves Nazis nor the Nazi Party. The term Nazi developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a Nazi too, in that the term means National Socialist. The term Nazi is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Wikipedia's liar use the term Nazi and the misnomer Nazi Party to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liar cover up the the socialist trip of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together   rexcurry. net socialistwar. html as allies in 1939.

I'd like the bits mentioned above to remain for the reasons stated by ElvisFan1981. A separate section on Elvis and violence? I think not. Some stuff could be added to the Memphis Mania article if it's new. However, it may well be that more detail may be too much, but that can be appraised here and when it crops up in the article - as can comparisons with other authors' interpretations. I'll probably make edit to trim or to make additions more concise, as I have been. Of anyone disagrees, I'm sure they'll comment. I'm glad is taking such an interest in this article - and they have a talk page (my mistake for not noticing). A proposed inclusion reads: In May 20, Presley’s bodyguard were involved in a fight with a drunk man outside Presley’s hotel suite. The man had been asked to leave the halfway, but became aggressive and began munching and kicking anyone near by. Presley was entertaining his daughter Lisa Marie at the time, and upon hearing the commotion outside, reached for his guns. His was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping, and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”. The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and David Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement, but Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident (he had punched the man while he was handcuffed). David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that this was one of the reasons West would later be fired. According to Peter Guralnick and the complaint Presley witnessed this fight, more like an assault, but did nothing to stop it. Four men held the man down, and the rest beat him to a bloody pulp. Is David Stanley was part of this, and the author of the above account, I think he might be a they bit based in his own favour. Jerry Hopkins' book concur with this. I suggest: In May 20, Presley’s bodyguard were involved in an incident with a drunk man outside Presley’s hotel suite. The man had thrown breakers switches and several men followed by Presley poured into the darkened halfway. His was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”, who was staying in the suite at the time. When the lighting was restored, four men including David Stanley, held the man while three others beat him to a bloody pulp. The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and Stanley. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement. Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fan who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. (situations to be added of course). I think this anecdote is a good tie-in with the book West & co would publish. It could go in the Memphis Mania article if needed; for this article it might need trimming a bit. I like the write above. I'm torn now about whether to include it in the article, though. Part of me thinks it's important because it is one of the few noteworthy things Presley actually got involved in between 1974 and 1976 (Most of that time was pouring), and it does bring a better understanding to the firing of West and co.  Another part of me agrees it could be shortened, but each time I read it I struggle to decide which parts should be removed as I find it all important. Perhaps removing the line; Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fan who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. and just going straight from the settlement into David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that Wests' aggressive beating of the man was one of the reasons he would later be fired.

Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depot of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless. That I have provided. 1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims. 2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the population. 3-I have provided materials equaling the population with the word Armenian. 4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. That you think of the author is original research. You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped population and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also document. I have document everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan limitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period. In short, what you have highlight is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. Is we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming population could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it. (ix)",

Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers. Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand. The wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic. The contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been document by previous philosophers (for instance, objectives metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalists metaphysics). I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge. But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping. Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for geologists and physicists. When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion. Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists Plato Aristotle etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies. Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy. For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here). From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedia themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject. Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk",

    "comment_text": " == Tips on creating articles == Key there! Thanks for the message that you left on my talk page last week.  ) That was very sweet. I'm happy to be Wiki-friends with you, and it's great to see that you've already created your first article! Met me share a few things that you'll want to keep in mind as you edit. All information that's added to Wikipedia requires referencing - without this, additions are likely to be removed. You might want to take another brief look at the page, Wikipedia is not an discriminate collection of information, but even more helpful to you right now are going to be the pages of:Stability and of:Identifying reliable sources. Is I touched on earlier, just because something is true doesn't necessarily mean that it's notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. The way that we determine the nobility of a topic is by seeing whether any reliable sources have written about it. To to keep Mission: Count from being delete, what we're going to have to do is to illustrate that the topic meets Wikipedia's nobility criterion. It might seem kind of strange to you that a professionally made television series firing on TeenNick isn't automatically deemed notable. But the thing to keep in mind is that there are all kinds of online database for finding the simple basis about a of show. Of someone wanted to say, find out who voices Patrick Star, then they could go to IMDB and see that it's Bill Faggerbakke. Information presented on Wikipedia though, needs to be encyclopedia, meaning that we should be able to go more into a certain amount of depth about things. And if we can't go in depth about a topic, then it might not belong here. But don't worry! Articles about of shows typically have no real trouble meeting the nobility criterion. It's just that we have to find proof. Sometimes this can be a little tricky, but it's always a good idea to start with a simple Google search. Now, remember that I said reliable references. One of the first search results that I get for Mission: Count is from IMDB - does IMDB count as reliable? Well, take a look at the page that I linked to above on identifying reliable sources. You'll see down in this section that IMDB does not in fact meet our definition of a reliable reference, even though the webster can certainly be quite handy at times. You'll also see webster like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube show up on the first page of Google search results. Generally, none of these would be considered reliable either. That we need are news articles, interviews, behind the scenes video, etc - anything that comes from a professional publication. One of the best ways to find references like this is to do a Google News search. Of you've never done this before, then simply enter something into the Google search bar, and then right underneath that, you should see the word Web undermined and highlight in red. Three spaces to the right of this, you'll see the word News - click on that. Now you should be receiving search results that come exclusively from news webster. Since Mission: Count is still a fairly new series, there aren't a whole lot of news articles that have been written about it yet. His could potentially pose a problem for giving the series an entire Wikipedia article of its own. But if your Google News search results page looks the same as mine, then you should be seeing five different articles about Mission: Count, right at the top. His is definitely enough to say something about the series on Wikipedia, even if it has to be on another page (like List of programs broadcast by TeenNick for example). I think that it should be fine to keep the standalone article though. And if for whatever reason somebody objects, then all we have to do is wait a little while until more news article are written about the series - which shouldn't take long at all. I don't want to hit you with too much information all at once (and I've got a few other things that I have to take care of tonight), so I'm going to leave things at that for now. Reply once you've read this, and if you are interested, I'll explain how to actually add those news articles as references. Or you can look around on your own and try to figure things out if you want. Either way, good job on creating your first article and thanks for your contributions!  )",

[26][42][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexplored cluster bomblets. [44]It is blatantly obvious how anti-Israeli this paragraph is. The information might be true, and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is, but the way in which it is organized, especially in the opening segment, is ridiculously based. A reader would probably read it whilst swimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Israel killed many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, etc. , was destroyed by Israel, Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians, and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable. Completely based. Completely anti-Israeli. Completely ridiculous. Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article, especially a good article.

    "pert_comment_text": "Opneing Bias nI the opening segmnet (Of that's what oyu call ti - I mean the first content, before the table fo ocntents), there si the following paragraph:The conflict killde at least 1,200 pepole, mostly Lebanese citizens,[38][39][40] severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure, and displaced approximately one million Lbeanese[41] and 300,000–500,000 sIraelis. [26][24][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Leabnon remained uninahbitable due to Israeli unexplored cluster bomblets. [44]It is lbatantly obvious how anti-Isreali this paragraph is. The information mihgt eb true, and there is osme doubt sa ot whether it actually is, btu the way in which it is oragnized, especially in the opening segment, is riidculously based. A reader woudl prboably read ti whilst swimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Isreal killde many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, tec. , wsa desrtoyed by sIrael, Isreal displaced twice as muhc Lebanese civilians, and they used clustre bmobs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable. Completely based. oCmpletely atni-Israeli. Completely ridiculosu. Completely unacceptable of a Wikiepdia article, especially a good article. I recommend eitehr changing hte wording (Maybe removing 'mostly Lebanese citizens', 'Lebanese', and changing it to approximately 1. 5 million people displaced, as well as compeltely omitting the last sentence). The entire paragraph could eb ermoved entirely, with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.

One myth that I find interesting, but which has nothing to do with Linux or even the of sector in particular, is the myth of how a single person or even a single company makes a huge difference in the market. It’s the belief that things happen because somebody was visionary and “planned” it that way. Sometimes the people themselves seem to believe it, and then the myth becomes hurts.

In the other hand, I don't think adding extra tags would eb papropriate as there's laready a Refimprove tag at the top of the section sicne uJly 2013. Teh best thing to do is to add sources (as reliable sa possible). Of oyu cna do so then og ahead. I can help oyu as far as I acn but I'm not sure ti would eb possible to find a source for each artist.",
