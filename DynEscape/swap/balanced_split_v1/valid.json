In the other hand Wikipedia:To original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include. original philosophical works. ’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate pouring is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages. ’The above enables me to derive some conclusions: That is mend by “third-party sources” (of:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). Of the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [. . ] to substantiate material within articles. ’Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern. ’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the situation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. The also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material. The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages. ’ Met’s now focus on that.",

And the Hardy Boyz Reunion has been talked about happening at Wrestlemania 23. No Rumors.

Perhaps that should be entered into the article. Richard stage name Even, and especially, if you claim that Hardy is their real last name and not a stage name, then there is an unbelievable coincidence then that they chose to be called the Hardy Boyz and not the Hardy Brothers,, the Hardies or whatever. His does not distract from their image, don't take it personally. Please explain why Hardy Boyz has no relation to anything else and was a pure creative idea. I'm sorry if I sound rude, but do you even watch wresting? To you have any clue what you are talking about? Hardy is their legal last name. Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. To they are called the Hardy Boyz. Jeez, you would think if you wanted to edit a wresting article, you would at least know what you are talking about. Again, sorry if you take this offensively, but its the truth. (talk) While you continue to ignore my argument, the argument you use is childish and preposterous and you really don't care if I watch wresting, which leagues or since when either. Whether Hardy is their real last name or not is not the issue. The facts are that a) whether you like it or not, Hardy Boyz is a stage name, not unlike the Hart Foundation, and the Beverly Brothers, b) the Hardy Boys existed way before the Hardy Boyz adopted this variation. Soon your going to tell me that the name 'Hulk' in Hulk Hogan, has nothing to do with the previous usage regarding the green giant? Nobody has claimed a copyright violation, and I have absolutely no clue, and frankly wikipedia does not care, why you think that you have master editing rights on this article. First, The Hart Foundation were called that because the real names of the characters are Bret HART and Jim NeidHART. Please do some research first, since they are sometimes called the Hardy's. Maybe they chose Hardy Boyz instead of Hardy Brothers because of the books, you would have to ask Matt or Jeff that. Their real legal names are Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy though. Of you would only listen to yourselves, you'd hear that their real name isn't 'Hardy Boyz' at all, and that they've chosen this stage name over Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. of, you maybe they chose. is the whole point, you and Mike have no other clue.
