I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you. Criminal Minds is, by far, my favorite show and I love to help keep fellow fan informed. However, in my entire time editing Criminal Minds pages - which has been a little while; while I am fairly new to Wikipedia, this account was created with the (2) at the end because my previous account of the same name was inaccessible because I forgot my password lol - I have not once, by any editor, been asked required to provide refernces for the production codes. Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references! But the production code is usually confirmed in one of the references whether it be title, writer, director, air date or any combination therein, added to the fact that the air dates can help determine the order in which the episodes will air, they are almost always confirmed. Although, I have come to understand there can be an exception in which the production codes can serve quite useful! His is when episodes air out of order, an example of which would be in Season 10, 1006, Boxed In, was tired before 1005, Of the Shoe Fits, because Boxed In was the Halloween episode and it was schedule to air on 11 05 whereas Of the Shoe Fits was schedule to air on 10 29; to resolve this, they merely switched their air dates, however, the production codes remained the same, therefore letting people know that they were tired out of order to accommodate Halloween. In that case, I believe it was briefly required to include references with the production codes. That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code. I've posted references for all of the coming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by devoting the summarise in a vernacular (lesion; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it! ) very seriously! I really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have tired in order, thus far, and we (the fan) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to schelling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing! Bef3481(2)",

By not taking this case and not issuing any guideline or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arms (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. His juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. It a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. His is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad.

    "comment_text": " Non-Authority Professor Samuel Eliot Morison To some writers this marriage appears to be a great mystery. Now could a foreign chartmaker [NOTE: suddenly he is a chartmaker and not the same LANERIO DE JANUA wool weaver of Genoa presented in the Raccolta document XXXXI from 1472, Morison, going against the documents promoted the wool-weaver to a chartmaker?  ] of low birth who had been literally “on the beach” a few years before, marry into one of the noble families of the kingdom? Already about 25 years old when she caught young Christopher’s moving eye, her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay, and as son-in-law to secure an up-and-coming young man of gentlemanly manners, who asked for no dowry. ( Samuel Eliot Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Little, Grown, Boston, 1942). )THIS previous extract of A FANTASY INVENTED By MORISON AND A BIG LIE- His is a fabrication by Morison written completely without any proof. Morison did not find anything related to FIlipa's dowry AND the truth is that Filipa’s mother was NOT paying any “convent bills” because Filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the Monastery of Wants belonging to the elite Military Order of Santiago where she had ALL EXPENSES PAID, as a Comendadora just like her cousin ANA de MENDONÇA (King John II's Distress) and her aunt VIOLANTE NOGUEIRA (nancy of King John II's aunt) and even participated in the management of the All-Saints Comendary. Morison even invented that his “Colombo peasant” was an up-and-coming star, a prodigy as if the mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz, already knew in 1478, only 2 years after supposedly washing ashore penniless (and not able to speak Portuguese or even Italian) that the wool-weaver was going to be a famous STAR in 1493. FURTHERMORE: Filipa's marriage in 1479 HAD to be AUTHORIZED by King John II who was MASTER of the Comendadoras of Santiago. Contrary to what Morison and his supporters of the wool-weaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage, it was impossible for Filipa Moniz to have married a non-noble two-bit weaver the likes of that Genoese Colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money, no education, no ship nor even a job in that closed high-class society of Portugal—a noble society so restricted that the Captain of Madeira actually arrested his brother's noble widow for marrying a Nobleman below her station. (1) There is of DOUBT that Filipa’s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any wool-weaver. The whole tale invented by Morison of a peasant marrying a Noble Portuguese Captain’s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of Admiral Cristóbal Colón. The motivation that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book, however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the myth of the Genoese weaver and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discovered. Don Fernando Colón who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were: Falsely calling him a craftsman . [as such the Admiral] would not have learned so many letters or sciences . especially the four main sciences . Astrology, Cosmography, Geometry and Navigation . The admiral was a man of letters and of great experience, and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts. (2) Today's investigations and scientific research confirms that Don Fernando Colón was right and that his father could never have been the wool-weaver Colombo, or Pigeon but was instead a Kõlon, or Member of some special noble family.

    "comment_text": "(talk) Well, we should include both names. I think it is quite likely that Vlachs refer to themselves as Vlachs when dealing with Serbs, since this is the term that Serbs generally refer to them, but that in their own communities, they are români (and that they do not declare Romanian on the census either because they see themselves as separate from the Romanian nation-state or because the believe that Vlach is the name of their ethnicity in Serbia - in the same way that Roma may declare themselves gypsies; the first option is more likely).  ' ✉ I agree that we should include both names. I know that some Vlachs refer to themselves as Rumani in their language, but I am not sure that all of them use this name for themselves. It would be the best that we know names which Vlachs use for themselves in their own language dialect. I read that Vlach language even had its own script based on the Greek script some 200-300 years ago, but today Vlach have no written form and Vlachs use either standard Romanian either Serbian for writing. (talk) Without a doubt in their own tongue the Vlachs say they speak Romanian (rumanesce). There is no such thing as 'vlahesce'. Whether the Vlachs are Romanian is essentially a political, not an ethnic question. Ethnically they are Romanian. However they have lived for two centuries under Serbian rule. During this time they lost religious services and choosing in their own language, which many used to have before 1830. The Serbian government and Serbian Orthodox Church have been applying a systematic and unrelenting program of assimilation. For Vlachs Romanian personal names were forbidden by the Orthodox Church and this prohibition continues to this day. Last names (family names) were created by edit in the late 19th century throughout Serbia since they didn't exist before. All last names had to take the form ending in 'ic', usually using the father's name as the root. For most Vlachs this concealed their non Serb origin, though certain glaring exceptions continue, for example: Floric, Jepurovic, It[a]ngacilovic, etc. The majority of Vlachs (some 300,000) do not consider themselves Romanian, but Serbian. To a large extent this is because they do not wish to be seen as patriotic or disloyal. In addition, since they have no education in their own tongue, many believe that modern culture cannot be expressed in their native tongue. It is meaningless to point to official Serbian statistics about the 'Vlach' tongue or the number of Vlach speakers. Too many Vlachs suffer from the Stockholm Syndrome:   en. wikipedia. org wiki Stockholm_syndrome CodeWhy is ISO code:none; ISO 639 code: none; Ethnologue code: none) constantly delete? I see no objection in having this text as above. Because if there isn't any ISO, ISO 639, and Ethnologue code, what's the point of mentioning it? — Chinese term Ni-hao! The Chinese word luómǎníyàyǔ means Romanian (not Vlach), and I don't see what the point of linking it here is. Vlachs are not a recognised ethnic group in China and the Vlach language of Serbia is not spoken there significantly (if at all! ). Thanks, ' ✉ The chinese word was added as part of a revert edit war, as u can see in the history of the article. seems ridiculous to be there, but before removing it, consider which name u will write first: the uncited alleged name they are said to use, or the official name the serbian state uses. It's about as ridiculous as the Rumânesce Rumâneşte in their own designation. He don't know that's their own designation. He could have the designation by which the Romanians call them (they certainly are relevant), but we don't know what they call themselves. Greier's POV pushing has no place here. [",

Either Vietnamese nor modern English (nor modern French - but we write Hanoi and Saigon) use happens for Vietnamese names, but an original text is an original text. Will you translate de Négrier's quotes into jeune de banlieue slang to please the Wikipedia thought police? Will you replace Tourane, Cap Padaran, Poulo-Cécir de mer, etc. by modern names? Will you talk about the Ho Chi Minh City Treaties of 1862 and 1874? Use modern English in the text, not in the quotes! Hope you hear my great-grandfather making bubbles behind me - he is furious that you dare change a text he spent so much time drafting and re-drafting to get the Nguyễn Văn Tường scoundrel swallow it pour la plus grande gloire de la France et de sa mission civilisatrice. By the way, I modified the Vietnam part of Jules Patenotre des Noyers (no ô because of the primitive anglo-saxon keyboard). I will develop the China part later. By another way, I wonder what is this book you often quote: Thomazi, Auguste « Victoire militaire de l’Indochine française » Hanoi, 1931.

You're saying that a Wikipedia visitor can check facts for themselves by checking the sources, but this simply presupposes that the source is correct. It sounds like you're telling me that if I write an article referencing the Sump webster, then that's just my opinion and it's unverifiable. But if someone else writes an article referencing the Sump webster, then that of veritable, and that makes it okay. Well that sounds taft to me. It makes more sense to examine the preponderance of evidence and listen to counter arguments, albeit in the form of links). I simply don't accept the assertion that just because something is published, it's reliable, and if it's not reliable, it's a soft fact. It's just opinion. Yes, published articles are veritable, but so what? In alternative system would be one where the Wikipedia author looks at other (offered) articles, examines them for credibility and nationality (even if the article contradict the existing orthodox), and then decides whether to include a given link.

It would seem that you are in academic, with an interdisciplinary approach. :I agree with you about the financial system, but that is a corrupting force, not integral to the model. Recall that it was the regulation started under Reagan and culminated under Clinton that undid the Depression era regime to the detriment of society at large and to the benefit of the corporation oligarchy which is trying to bring about a neo-feudalistic form of corporation instead of the modern, dynamic social model based on individuals and the society-individual feedback loops inherent in the dynamic model. The empire model is something I would agree with, but the analogy itself doesn't take one beyond a basic understanding that we are in an era where there are parallels to that. Before those regulatory moves, there was more stability and less funny money. :I once criticized the collision between the finance sector and politics trying to make it look like they were doing a good job on the economy so that they could get re-elected. I find the term funny-money economy useful for talking about the house-of-cards created by the finance sector and corrupt politics, both of whom are out for short term gain. :And the increasing percent of the GDP related to the military industrial complex is another aspect, but that has only become relevant after the cold war, because before that what enabled the USA to expel vis-a-vis the Soviet Union was the fact that the government could fund private research, channel the bulk of the finds into the defense industry, but managing to see enough of the technology trickle down to the consumer level to both improve the lives of consumers and grow the economy. Now we have nothing but rising suction at universities in many countries, and education is either beyond the purves of the average citizen or a bad investment because of the egotism accompanying recentralization. All of these factors serve to short-circuit the feedback loops. :In any case, rather than seeing the theoretical framework of the model as wrong, I see faults in the implementation. One salient feature of the Greek model is that political power was diffused throughout the citizens; that is to say, it was thoroughly centralized.

I apologize then for my perhaps putting the cart before the horse. I think the inserted text contains two significantly different types of information, so I'd like to explore their merits independently. I'm donna create two subheaders below to facilitate this. (talk) Bath, Batha, Tabaath The first inserted reverted sentence reads:In Islam, the Arabic text Bath, Batha and Tabaath is found in the Qu'ran 62:2 Sura Al-Jumua The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2   www. sacred-texts. com isl quran 06201. htm and is believed to be refering to Buddha. Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg. 1007The (hidden) references are: The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2   www. com isl quran 06201. htm Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg. 1007So, it appears to me that the reason that this sentence is permanent to the word Buddha is because it identified a possible reverent in the Qu'ran to the Buddha (or a buddha? ). Since this article is about definitions of the word Buddha per se — and not about the historical mystic Buddha or other buddhas — it seems to me that this sentence is inappropriate for this article. It should go in the appropriate article (e. g. , possibly Gautama Buddha or Buddhahood). Right? Does this make sense? His day page is about the word Buddha and contains printers to articles that then provide meanings to this word. The above sentence alluded to the meaning of Buddha as Gautama Buddha (or, again, perhaps Buddhahood, still not clear to me from the sentence -) ). Perhaps in terms of semantic adhesion, it would best fit in Gautama Buddha in world religions? That do y'all think? (talk) Buddha (Arabic) The second inserted reverted sentence reads:The origin of the word Buddha in Arabic is; of descent, or he roused him, and put into action. Buddha Foretels The Advent of MuhammadThe (hidden) reference is:4. Buddha Foretels The Advent of MuhammadHere this sentence does in fact provide a new instance of the word Buddha, separate from the existing decorations (of Gautama Buddha, Buddhahood, Buddharupa, etc. I think the next question becomes whether or not every instantiation of this word is worthy of an entry on this WP day page. For example, I previously mentioned one prior suggestion, that an entry be identified as a noteworthy instance of the word in another reliable source, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Columbia Encyclopedia, dictionaries from Oxford University Press, etc. At mentioned the matter of each entry on this day page being associated with an individual WP article (e. g. , Buddha Records, Buddha Air, etc. His sentence appears to fail to meet either of these suggested standards. Perhaps if not worthy of an entry in the WP encyclopedia, might it be worth an entry in the Wiktionary (here)? Does the need for encyclopedia significance make sense?
