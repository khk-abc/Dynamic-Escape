Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He she is a female male” and I would adjust accordingly.

Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010. Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to he’; or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the he is actually a she and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the he is too balls or push to be a woman “lady. ” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she. ” On't be an ass. Of Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like Or. or Is. Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. Of you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. In second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc. ) doesn’t answer his question. It oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he. ” To doubt her boyfriend girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. Of Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a missy or a girl, then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banner. And by protector, I mean you. You are an ass. Pale. Female. Both. Either. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

There is an RfC which I am not familiar with and now you seem to have been blocking me whatever that is. Below you find the draft text of my letter to the professors. Of you think that this is threatening and not befitting a scientific community, please reply. A few hours ago I already sent this draft text to Rob Speer and Joe Hall. With an introductory text, that I no longer have, since wiki-mail has no cc. But they might forward the email sent to them. I would appreciate it if you could explain the problem and what I can expect. Please see also my recent edit of Arrow's impossibility theorenm. By regards,Thomas ColignatusDRAFTTo the president of MITProfessor Susan Hockfield  web. mit. edu hockfield   the dean of SIMS, University of California at BerkeleyProfessor Hal Varian  www. sims. berkeley. edu ~hal   11, 2006Dear professors Hockfield and Varian,Dear Hal,I have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students, Rob Speer at MIT who started the problem, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall at SIMS who is interfering in an helpful way. The problem is summarized in the appendix. Obviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academic so there must be a great deal of tolerable with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Met, students e. g.  know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity. In the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. By reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat. It is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. By impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. His is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph. D.  student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose. In the end, it is with",

Obviously, the integrity of science is a ;i;ficu;t subject even xor academic so there must ?e a gr{a{ ]ea] of tolerable with students.

In this case, these two students would \"ea\"n a lot about scientific conduct a\"d scientific integrity. In th' present case, the issue is on the behaviour of [h[se students on the //terne/, in particular <ik<p<dia. It appears $h$t communication with these students ;s greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect.

I find it strange that Buspar is so familiar with what the IP did only a few hours ago, and rushed to complain here, while he has not been contracted by the IP. Is if, by magic, he read every article that the IP has edited. Please Jehochman, explain me how could all this be possible without Buspar being the IP ? Anyway, it's Buspar that is harassing me. He's systematically cracking down every single one of my edit in articles about illegal fan translations and distribution of copyright material, so that he could rush to revert them and provoke me at the same time, then threatening to complain to admins. When, saying edit warring under his surname wouldn't work, he's started using anonymous was so that his revert would go unnoticed among the other edit. When he has used his was to try to game a consensus discussion, pretending there was various people against me while it was only him against me. Met me be clear, there has already been a Sockpuppet check on Buspar. The admin that was in charge of the case never denied that Buspar could be the was. Instead, the admin stated, and I quote, Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user [. . ] User:Buspar's userpage clearly states I've been editing Wiki off and on with various user names since 2003. I don't like sticking with a user name too long, because I've found that people start reacting to the user name more than the quality of the edit after a bit. Is I've said, the admin never denied or confirmed that Buspar wasn't using the was listed as arises. However, anyone that had to deal with you concerning articles will spot you right away. Strangely,  and Buspar both appear to be very active on the very same articles: Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008, Okashina Okashi - Strange Candy, Signum (Nanoha). Also, both of them seem to have a tendency of being involved in heated debates with me concerning illegal fan translations and distribution of copyright material. Strangely, both users' intervention in these cases tended to add pov statements in favor of illegal downloading while I tried to prevent this, as it was an obvious violations of policies. And I'm again stating that if he's Buspar, then calling him by one of his surname is not an offence. It would be if he wasn't Buspar, but this remain to be proved. The only thing is that I don't like him using an anonymous IP when he's reverting my contributions, because I like honesty, and hiding under anonymity when attacking me is never a sign of good faith. I'm only establishing his identity, which, if he's Buspar, cannot be an attack in any way. You'll note that I'm not going after every edit of the IP in order to call it Buspar (however he's always there as soon as I edit an article like fansub, fandub, scanlation. ), I'm merely reacting when he's targetting my edit. I realize, however, that I might not have chosen the best way to deal with the matter. To to calm things down, I offer to stop calling him Buspar if that's what he'd like, under the condition that either him or an admin acknowledge that Buspar and the IP are indeed linked.",

I would like to ask you how can I (or some administrator) change back the wrong presentation of the South Slavic languages and dialect division, placed in the chart, which is placed in the right side of the articles about Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Bunjevac and Serbo-Croatian language? In the chart named 'Hart of South Slavic languages and dialect' someone has changed the basically known fact that the politically created standards of the SerboCroatian language, such as Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Bunjevac, etc. , they all belong to the Central South Slavic languages, and they don't belong in the same group with Slovenian language (which is Western group of South Slavic Languages). Please if you can, help me correct back this actual state of the things in this chart, because like it is now - it gives a wrong information to the readers. It should be like it was before,-showing: Serbian, Croatian, Bunjevac, and Bosnian in the SAME group of dialect, and that group is CENTRAL South Slavic Diasystem. Thanks;Is for the one who is complaining about me above, please don't have in mind that he is the one who started first with the vanalism, calling me names and easing my edit on some 'talk' pages. I know that it's not of your business, just to let you know. West Regards,",

I know your the one with the admin powers but my heart bleeds when i see what names you have been called in your time, it burns me to the bone. I can just stand and watch anymore, its time for someone to do something. But please my dear, can you read one of your lovely poems to me? You have such a wonderful voice that it would make for the perfect bed time story. Its not really romantic listening to the wiki policies or the Cali. gold rush. Please, pretty, pretty please.",
