You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to cancer. It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Most a diff that backs that comment up. Must one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cents. Would you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cents (pl) or even a person a count? Of course you can, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was locking. You back out of it by saying Am not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do, as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence. The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I breed cancer, that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or disturbing it. Such of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, fas, ANI, AE, AN3, . , and the arbitration cases. To I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. His user has had their account vanished to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is delete, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of locking, how much is one of the things I dont know. His happened late 2007 early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start locking. Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA sobbing issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. The, dishonesty losing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bank against that admin. The followed him from article to article, going away from the A I area into random areas such as Persian history. The was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Losing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who? ). The is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edit just waiting to be put in to use. To Dajudem began locking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued locking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? Now can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly locked? But back to the point, dont make accusations that you can provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a count or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowing overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy -",

Knowing this was going to happen, I brough a Mudkips doll. Thus I started the conversation, making sure no one saw me. To I heard you like Mudkips. Mudkips? I LUUUUUUUUUUUUVE MUDKIPS. O RLY? To, would you ever fuck a Mudkips, that is. (he cuts me off before I could said 'if you were a mudkips') of COURSE. Well I just happen to have a Mudkips here, and. Before I finished the sentence, which would have resulted in me hitting him across the face with the doll, he grabbed it. In one swift motion his parts were down and he was violenly jumping it. Not to get between a man and his Mudkips I started to walk away, because there is no way I'd be caught wresting a half-naked crazy guy jumping a Mudkips. Needles to say, within 5 to 10 seconds, some girls saw him and started screaming. I cooly walked into a restroom, pretending nothing had ever happened; not that I had intended that outcome, but now that it was in play I didn't want to be involved. I came back two minutes later, and like any wanton act on school grounds there was now a huge crowd round him. He was still fucking it and baying this real tucked up 'EEEEEEEEEEINNNNF EEEEEEEEEEINNNF' sound. Suddenly a scuffle broke out in the middle, meaning he probably did something stupid. I asked someone what had happened. A girlfriend of one of the football players tried to get him to stop, but he bit her for trying to take it away. Someone called in a few football players (all dressed up like Road Warrior) who proceeded to summer the shit out of the guy. Meanwhile the school police were breaking out and having trouble getting in to the situation. A few minutes later the intruder alarm went off and we were shuffled into classroom. Over the interior the principal announced that someone had thrown a flaming plush toy into the library. Oh. what the hell. To we were kept there and about 30 minutes later the principal came on again. His time he was saying that whoever was behind the beating should turn themselves in. All of a sudden this woman began yelling I WILL SUE YOU FOR DAMAGES. YOU LITTLE PUNKS, I'M GONNA SUE. and it was cut off. I asked an office later what had happened. Apparently his mother had come to pick him up and threatened to sue for the beating and 'whatever else happened. ' The school threatened to counter-sue because of led conduct, inciting a riot, and starting a fight. To I ask you: do you like Mudkips?",

I don't want bad blood between us. I do have a POV, of course. He all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is the trade POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links further reading (not sources), then traditionalist webster deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to In Orthodox Hannukah or Deformed Headings for Hannukah, but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add a traditional Catholic site tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removed and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summarise. I am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled a traditional Catholic site or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex. , is labelled a conservative or neo-conservative site not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains). I'm glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary! (I think if you looked at the links mentioned in my of, you will actually like them, too at least most of them. Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the Customs of the Liturgical Year section. There is nothing like it out there on the Met, and I'm not finished yet! ) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives neo-conservatives: you use the phrase attacks on Pope John Paul II with regard to the footnotes about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an attack but a criticism. Even St.  Paul himself resisted St.  Peter, our first Pope, to the face when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St.  Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understanding of fallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or frightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about). But no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics! ), there is a trade movement out there, and we have as much right to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to Anglican Rosary practices. I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censured, and it frustrate me (it doubly frustrate me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled blow or [[monograph|monograph]. It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it). I will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word a traditional Catholic site or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trade site is clear. Of I come across any older links that have already been added (and not all have been added by me, BTW), I will edit to do the same. Round good? I am glad you wrote; I feel TONS better already.",

    "comment_text": " January 2010 (UTC)Thank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”. “His section was started with discussion of bias in favor of Darwin's theory raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-revolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution. ”I certainly agree with that. But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsity the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper). Now, I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is prove, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and vigorous testing are more “corroborate” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”). Anyway, so much for theory. Is far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about meeting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether? You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalists who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?

In consequence, the Negro jaw is substantially longer, relative to its width, than the White jaw. A feature of the Negro lower jaw is its retention of a vestige of the similar shelf, a bony region immediately behind the incisors. The similar shelf is a distinguishing characteristic of apes, and it is absent in Whites. *The skin of the Negro is thicker and possibly superior to the White's in the way it impedes the penetration of germs and in its protection from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. *The dark color of the Negro is due to melanin pigment which is spread through every layer of the skin and is found even in the muscles and brain. *Negroes have arms which are longer, relative to body height, than those of Whites. His feature, together with their much thicker cranial bones, gives Black athletes an advantage over Whites in boxing. The skeleton and muscular peculiarities of Negroes' lower limbs have given them considerable success as printers, but have left them relative distinguished as distance runners *The hair is black, crisp, and woolly in texture, it is flat and elliptical with no central canal or duct like the hair of Europeans. *The nose is thick, broad and flat, often turned up nostrils exposing the red inner lining of the mucous membrane similar to an ape. *The arms and legs of the Negro are relatively longer than the European. The humerus is a trifle shorter and the forearm longer thereby approximating the similar form. *The eyes are prominent, iris black and the orbit large. The eye often has a yellowish sclerotic coat over it like that of a gorilla. *The Negro has a shorter trunk, the cross-section of the chest is more circular than whites. The pelvis is narrowed and longer as it is in an ape. *The mouth is wide with very thick, large and protruding lips. *Negro skin has a thick superficial horny layer which resists scratching and impedes the penetration of germs. *The Negro has a larger and shorter neck akin to that of anthropoid. *The cranial sutures are more simple than in the white type and close together earlier. *The ears are rounds, rather small, standing somewhat high and detached thus approaching the similar form. *The Negro is more powerfully developed from the pelvis down and the white more powerfully developed in the chest. *The jaw is larger and stronger and protrudes outward which, along with lower retreating forehead, gives a facial angle of 68 to 70 degrees as opposed to a facial angle of 80 to 82 degrees for Europeans. *The hands and fingers are proportionately narrowed and longer. The wrist and ankles are shorter and more robust. *The frontal and paricial bones of the cranium are less excavated and less capacious. The skull is thicker especially on the sides. *The brain of the Negro on the average is 9 to 20% smaller than whites. *The teeth are larger and are wider apart than in the white race. *The three curvatures of the spine are less pronounced in the Negro than in the white and thus more characteristic of an ape. *The femur of the Negro is less oblique, the tibia (skin bone) more curved and bent forward, the calf of the leg high and but little developed. *The heel is broad and projecting, the foot long and broad but slightly arched causing flat soles, the great toe is shorter than in the white. *The two bones proper of the nose are occasionally united, as in apes.

But of course the most sensitive nationality [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, I've always thought so, to which Bukharin allegedly replied: Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do? That they, or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact inappropriate for publication and decree that it be kept secret. In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe and the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses. Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar 'tenacity' in struggle and a highly revolutionary disposition. Generally speaking, she concluded, I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Magically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities. Stalin's response was an order to keep absolutely quiet. Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition (pgs. 245–246) All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the great leaders of democracy and socialism came from the best representatives of the Jewish world. Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and this fact was another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe, and that Lenin had always contrasted what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character. (p.  163) And in 1965, all arrival documents relating to Lenin's Jewish grandfather were ordered removed without leaving any copies. (pg. 338)",

Hj Mitchell, please spare us the dramatic of, I'll quite if you give me a reason. To one here thinks you will quite regardless of any reasons given nor would you be expected too. You are also fully aware that no one is going to mine through your edit looking for wrongdoing. That's just a waste of time and you would likely retort with they are NOTHERE. That I will do, is give you a few examples of what I have seen over a very short span of time. Given a review of any say, month long period, I think we will find the same result within a few percentage points of the mean. You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributory to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. His caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence. After reviewing the comment Protonk made, I certainly agree it was a bad comment, but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Tucking mormons because you were the submitted of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt. In event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for. Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit. You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt. His can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives. Is mentioned above, and as noted by several individuals, your Tucking mormons''' comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary. You recently unlocked and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and rolling regarding gender topics and gamergate. Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks, has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned avenues. Even based on your comments here, you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else what good for Wikipedia. That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary. You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement. Personally, I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later. There is no way you scrutinized all those and I can easily see a lot of mistakes and preventing useful edit from being done through bad faith assumptions of guilt, similar to those you displayed towards me for criticizing your actions. I could keep going, but that is enough IMO to show a pattern of conduct not appropriate of a functionary.",

Ron Dennis arrived at McLaren not before September 1980, so McLaren was non-involved in the preparation of the BMW M1 Procars.

Hans-Joachim Stuck gained only 73 points. the German having won twice in his Limp entry.

Moreover I checked the BMW publication Mobile Tradition live 2003 M1 Special – 25 years of the BMW M1: Instead of finishing up at Baur, the pre-assembled M1 cars in this case went either straight to BMW Motorsport or to the renowned tuning companies of Osella in Italy or Ron Dennis in England for final production, with the selection and supply of parts handled by the Munich company.

For her time, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world. In the night of 14 April 1912, during the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on 15 April 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The high casualty rate was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard. The ship had a total lifeboat capacity of 1,178 people, although her capacity was 3,547. A disproportionate number of men died due to the women-and-children-first protocol that was followed. The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and was popularly believed to have been described as unthinkable. [6] It was a great shock to many that, despite the extensive safety features and experienced crew, the Titanic sank. The frenzy on the part of the media about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have contributed to the continuing interest in, and notoriety of, the Titanic.

They view their own accent as the correct one. That do you think somebody from Georgia or Texas would think of that? Is this another to the victor goes the spoils from the Civil War? The north gets to have the correct accent? The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can fattest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska than? Well no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is the bomb, but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled bahm. Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulated, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they he no trace of the New England weariness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worcester, forget it. very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people. Young kiss in Vermont are not carrying this on at all. The old times with their Pepperidge Faam Remembas accent with all the ayaah, well that was a Swedish accent and the grandchildren of the Swedes don't talk that way anymore. Not at all. Is for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. Is far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplant and no accent at all, except for the redness. And what can you do about the redness?",

    "comment_text": "Thanks . I'll edit from the beginning of next month. To harm in dropping a reply to your note, since writing here is hardly editing wiki. Were Michael's mind open to rational persuasion, he would have yielded on this long before. His objection is, at this point, ideological. More examples will not convince him. That we all get things wrong at times is easy to see. That is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong, and why we persist in error. In the Israeli Jewish side of this common problem, there are two elements, one cultural, one a matter of the politics of image-forging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived. I think Michael's error is to be classified in the former, which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of Jewish exceptionalism, and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise Palestinian realities that might remind one of similar Jewish realities, is repressed. Michael dislikes 'uprising' because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the Warsaw uprising. There is a deeper analogy. The Romans crushed Bar Kochba's revolt (which in the historical literature is often described as an 'uprising'), and under Hadrian set out to Romanize Judea. The creation of Israel indicates Bar Kochba, but also, in rejudaising Palestine, creates an implicit structural analogy between the fantastic resistance of Bar Kochba, and the PLO James the Al-Aqsa type violence, esp. sacred violence in the name of national restoration. His analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myth of Jewish exceptionalism, since those who evoke the myth of Masada must at the same time war down a native people who are rattling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory, very much as Bar Kochba himself did. Rabbinical schools after the failure of Bar Kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states, one which lasted until the creation of Israel redeemed the earlier foundation myth of the Took of Joshua, and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic military of the first invasion of Banana. Ironically, what is expected of Palestinians is that they cringe before the power of Israel's occupation: any phenomenon bearing a genetic resemblance to the sicarii, or zealotism, is dismissed as an appalling 'Arab cultural trait': though in fact it resonates, mutatis mutandis, with analogies from Jewish history under the Roman empire from Titus to Hadrian, where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished. The early Zionists from Jabotinsky to Ben-Gurion to Moshe Dayan and Menachem Begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonance. Being thorough reality, they didn't have to kid themselves. Today we live in the fog of public opinion myth, where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness. People are raised on the standard clichés, endless recycle by hasbara machines, and underwrite them sincerely, because they no longer have much of a sense of history. Such could be said of this. But this is not the place. Regards",
