Jack Merridew - I see that you went and posted somewhere else that Miley Cyrus's fan can't have their own colour scheme. Idiot, I had never even heard of this Miley Cyrus creature until I happened upon her page, and - to be quite frank - I don't think I would like her music if I were to hear it - I'm 55 years old. Nitwit. But you're a know-it-all, aren't you Jack? You know how I know that? Because I went and looked at your edit, and you apparently spend half of every day editing Wikipedia entries, and most of your edit are to do with table forgetting and font forgetting that you don't like.

Computer: I don't know. Activating the interior in the engine section. Did: Key goddammit! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there? Earliest instance of ShitShinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either! Tifa: Barret! Barret: #^*$! You lucky #$#*! Loud: To, what are we donna do now? Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…In total, Fuck is said uncensored once, Shit is said uncensored 12 times, ass is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), Damn is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of Bastard. Censured words appear approx. 33 times. By version must be different. The fuck is censured, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it shi't. I noted a lot of uncensored ass and shit though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language. In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profundity. But yes, it was at least partially censured. Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary pouring from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er Well, the box says it's rate been for mild language and violence. But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue. Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of into belongs in an encyclopedia. And even the slight mention is if to me. Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language. But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guideline of the time. It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censured than the PSX version. Almost every instance of shit was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees, for example, was changed to something likely more grammatical correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version. I have the of version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Did lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much. Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. Slightly stretched underwear was changed to Therapeutic underwear. Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought slightly stretched was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence. )Mentioning Midgar's futureDuring the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greeley. His sentence should be removed as it is trivial, unnecessary, and uhhh too minor for mention, and there is no explanation for this scene. NEWL",

[5][6] However, while the Ben Ali regime was falling apart in January 2011, he started to support the Tunisian revolution, as chronicle in his book Printemps de Tunis (2011: Albin Michel). And in a 2012 interview in Le Courrier de l'Atlas, entitled Islamism is an impoverished, stupid and detestable interpretation of Islam, Meddeb refutes the accusations head-on: :Indeed, there is a chapter in Contre-prêches where I praise not the Ben Ali regime, but a Tunis which, under his dictatorship, continues to give its place to the liberated woman; Tunis is the only city in Islam (along with Istanbul), where one sees sovereign women, veiled, liberated, sure of themselves, living incoherently with feminist and gender theory (. . ) I have perhaps been the intellectual the most distant from this regime, without any ties of any kind, while some of our friends tried to reform it from within and failed, concluding that it was not referable. [7] :In March 2004, the Tunisian embassy in France organized a reception in honor of Meddeb. [8] The lead sentence almost seems to suggest Meddeb's support, claiming he regularly praised the regime, while the rest of the paragraph appears to me to directly contradict such a criticism, saying he supported the revolution overthrowing Ben Ali and quoting him directly addressing his criticisms. Given the ambiguity, it seems like the section doesn't have that much place in the article, unless it presents some kind of conclusion.",

    "comment_text": "A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish was into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith specialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pleasing never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T.  O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to consisting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99. 5 of in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. It the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. His was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965). ] The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox He), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and An War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the integument camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an symmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerrilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",

In his sequence of the Youtube video, the lines are accompanied by rather apt sequence from the aime (among them, the line When he's underwater does he get wet, | Or does the water get him instead? is accompanied by a clip of Ed sinking to the bottom of a body of water because of his prophetic limbs which happen to be made entirely of metal, hence his title the 'Fullmetal' Alchemist). Colonel Roy Mustang (ak the Flame Alchemist) is cast as Triangle Man. Promoted at one point to Brigadier General and later became Fuhrer (sp? ), he is constantly taking jaws at Edward (for a rather popular example, he more than occasionally jokes about Ed's height), though in one episode in the aime and a sidestory in the manga the two actually hold a battle on the parade grounds (with the Fuhrer's permission) Mustang wins by a comeback landslide in the manga, but in the aime the then-Colonel hesitated (possibly due to post-traumatic stress disorder, as surmised due to a flashback being shown at that moment in the aime of a young man he had to kill in the Ishbal War) and thus loses to Ed; it is from the aime episode that the video actually gets the majority of its Particle Man of Triangle Man forage. Major Alex Louis Armstrong () is cast as Universe Man; all State Alchemists (such as, as noted before, Armstrong and Edward) carry watches, and in both manga and aime the man proudly brandish his watch (supplying one shot used in the video if I recall), plus he is, despite his sheer size (he is easily tied with the husband of Izumi Curtis (sp? ) as the tables supporting character in the series) and power (he perform his particular brand of archery through the use of powerful punched one scene in the aime has him pick up a slab of concrete with one hand, toss it in the air, and punch it, thus turning it into a massive bullet repelled at high speed via the punch's force). In the video, his power and compassion are both seen . along with his merchant for losing (most likely a trait passed down the Armstrong family line for generations a lot of his many talents, from his archery to his skill at portraiture, seem to be this way). Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc is cast as Person Man, and aptly so; out of all his co-workers, he seems to suffer the most problems, particularly in his love life Mustang has effectively stolen every single girl he's dated in either series, aime or manga, with one exception (manga-only) being the homunculus Lust (going under the alias Solaris; admittedly, it was a poor choice, as she later was proved to have been using him and ended up wounding him in his leg to the point that he could not be of any use in the military, hence his subsequent resignation, plus the Flame Alchemist did in fact kill Lust during the same incident where she crippled Havoc). Hence, the line Triangle Man rates Person Man is given even more meaning with this Youtube video. (Ironically, when the line Gives his life in a garage can comes up, it shows Roy Mustang's old residence back when he was obsessed with, if I remember correctly, human transudation. )Must thought I'd share this.",

I don't have the book here, but Ladies describes cutting of funds to the minorities schools as a disguised attempt by Polish government to polonize them, done in the spirit of the raising nationalism that was prevailing in most European countries at that time. A shameful policy, without doubt - and stupid, in the country in which 1 3 of the population belonged to one minority or another. Ladies concluded that if the the Second World War would not had happened, and the policies were kept in place, Kresy might have been a scene of a civil war. Ukrainians were already throwing bombs and assasinating Polish politicians, and it was all 'going to hell in a handbasket'. In the other hand, as far as funding cuts go, one has to remember that it was the time of the Great Depression and so some budget cuts had to be done anyway - but the fact that it was the minority schools who faced most of the cuts was purely politicaly motivate. 01:",

In your message of today, I found a link, on which I was told:  The submission has not been accepted because it included copyright information, which is not permitted on Wikipedia. I looked at the draft and I cannot identify what information is supposedly copyright. I will be happy to remove or replace it, but what section are you referring to? Thank you for your help, Regards, Andre Under Dear Wanders: The page has now been delete, so I am going by memory, but it seems to me that large sections of the article were cut-and-paste copies from the organization's web site, laws, and conference advertising. That may not be exactly right; I've reviewed many pages since then. You will know better than I which text was your own words and which wasn't. Wikipedia can't accept text which has been published elsewhere, even by the person who originally published the text. The reason is that once an article is created, it can be changed and added to by any of the thousands of editors, and no longer belongs to its originator. It is then freely available to be copied by anyone. Any people who submit material to Wikipedia think that it is a giant web page costing service, where they can advertise their products and events. Actually, though, an encyclopedia is not like that. Each article has to be specially written by neutral editors, and not for anyone. It's good that you declared your conflict of interest, but now if you decide to write an article in your own words, you'll have to be especially careful to be neutral, and to include situations to independent sources such as news reports, magazine articles, journals, books, etc. to support the information, not the organization's web site. Any information that can't be independently confirmed should just be left out for now. When you are finished, others will add and change what you have written as they come across other sources of information. I hope that you find this helpful. —",

More significantly, the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in Scientology's worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion. In the basis of the I. R. S.  ruling, the State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists. The German Government regards the organization as a business, not a tax-exempt religion, the very position maintained for 25 years by the American Government. I think the NY Times writer clearly expresses the view here that the US abandoned their earlier view of Scientology as a business, as still espoused today by Germany. Note that the State Department Report referred to in the NY Times article is the Religious Freedom Report. The Religious Freedom Reports for Germany have discussed discrimination against Scientologists by the German state almost every year since the IRS decision, referring in 2006 for example to certain religious minorities, notably Scientologists. Following the 1993 IRS decision, the IRS wrote to foreign governments, happening a document entitled Description of the Scientology Religion to their letter and stating that various Scientology organizations had demonstrated that they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inured to the benefit of any private individual. Media references to the Scientology religion (and similar references to Scientology as a religion) are common. The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties says that Despite its legal stacks, Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States. Is for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the United States to determine what is or is not a religion, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, stated in a 1992 decision that Indeed, the IRS itself has stipulated in other cases that the Church of Scientology is a bona fide religion. ; so in the view of that court at least, the IRS has been quite capable of making such stipulation. The St.  Petersburg Times wrote in 1998 that After a 40-year battle, the IRS dropped its tax dispute with Scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in 1993. Such sources cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand as Scientologist misrepresentation. 466 ==",

Thanks for unloading some pictures to Wikipedia. I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for unloaded images. Sick an image name. When unloading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique. Remember that many images may be unloaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive. Source the image. In the image description page, explain where the image came from. Of you created the image yourself, then say so. Of it's from the web, give a URL. Of it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title. Provide copyright and license information. His part is a little bit thicker, but it's very important. The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it. Of it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (edifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright. To unload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction. ) To this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{of}}. He sure to mention that you created the image. Of you're using {{of}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain. Of you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might create, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image. Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content. His means that images cannot have a restriction such as only for use by Wikipedia, or for non-commercial use only, or for educational use. Images without a free license may be unable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page. Describe the image. To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood. A caution in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page. But a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caution on an article.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited was Carrington Colleges Group, Inc. , which appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. To reduce the chances of deletions, you might like to draft your article before submission, then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. To start creating a draft article, just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are longed in, and edit that page as you would any other. Of the page you created has already been delete from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page. The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. Of your surname does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of surname. Of you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributory' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queried you have! You can also just type on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Were are a few other good links for newcomers: *The five pillars of Wikipedia *Now to edit a page *Help pages *Tutorial *Now to write a great article *Manual of Style I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian!

Peter III of Aragon That is your rational for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edit are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w  a caution) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat parish portrait in low-resolution JPG formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese kingIn your last edit summary, you ask if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait, but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. Srnec, the problem is that we have different criterion. You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information. I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other. Of not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time. I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. To you have an argument? Why are your criterion better than mine? Really? When I resulted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me. Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. His discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right. Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will. Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Features Articles. They were reviewed by several editors. Stop with your edit warring. Lecen is aware of the three-revert rule. Are you? You've reverted four times on both Pedro I and Pedro II in the last 24 hours. You should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution, such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.",

During October, Heymid was blocked a third or fourth time for, well, doing what he always has and probably always will since he gets away with it. He appealed this block, the appeal was denied, then he appealed again, promising pretty much the same stuff he had promised when trying to have previous blocks lifted. I wrote nothing when he was blocked, nothing when he first appealed, nothing when the first appeal was denied, nothing when he appealed again and nothing when he was unlocked. Met you feel that I'm popping up at every venue, and when I did write a single message at somebody else's talk page, you immediately blocked me, without any warning, without any message in my talk page. I'm not sure if this is funny or sad or both. That I do know, however, is that I have absolutely no intent to appeal the block, so you might just as well remove my talk page access as well. -",

They despised the very core of African American culture, and if you are to maintain that this does not constitute racism, you are talking about a distinction without a difference.

It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it. First I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it's step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles. The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated   en. wikipedia. org wiki Misha (an Russian Olympic moscow, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed. Next I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. I created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref'd the neck out every statement per BPL which says He must get the article right. He very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an online situation. Contentions material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly source – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliable source to published sources with online situations. I did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling into from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where into seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I've found so far is an AP article. bigstory. ap. org article bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1. 1 million hits on Google for Boston Marathon Misha as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. The article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio into (granted there is limited into to report). Mostly it summarize a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam's radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the left were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources. There is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. By goal was to write an over reference, comprehensive, neutral, information article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far. Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was directed (as a sub for a deletions nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. BLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime. The absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and   en. org wiki Placeholder_name Anyway, considering how many people are searching this guy I expect he will be found and a page will get created or restored. Cheers,",

It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generate by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Father, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generate by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert sundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were prove to be generate by an odd arrangement of hussars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that a designer created flagella, science says no further information known. There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or define itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observance, respectable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a vigorous, scientific point of view. Of one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient to know that it discard centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like legitimate possibility or probable explanation.

I mean, that such authors in as Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel example may be taken from literature of India. Poet Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India.

But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. His way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N.  Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). He see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. To, many researches don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E.  g.  philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal.

The signers of the Declaration of Independence sat in Independence Hall at Philadelphia, contemplation losing their heads or being hanged. Their courage wavered. The document sat there signed. In extraordinary cataclysm was needed to move them to action. In unknown man rose and gave an electrifying speech. He disappeared soon after. By signing the Declaration, all were guilty of high treason under British law. The penalty for high treason was to be hanged by the neck until unconscious, then cut down and revived, then disemboweled and cut into quarters. The head and quarters were at the disposal of the crown. To wonder they wavered! To wonder they discussed back and forth for days on end before signing the document that carried so grave a penalty. In old legend dramatized the story of the one who galvanised the delegates and gave them the courage to sign that document. But still there is doubt–and that pale-faced man, shrinking in one corner, squeaky out something about axes, scaffold, and a–gibbon! Ribbed! echoes a fierce, bold voice, that startled men from their seats–and look yonder! A tall slender man rises, dressed–although it is summer time–in a dark robe. Took how his white hand undulates as it is stretched slowly out, how that dark eye burns, while his words ring through the hall. (He do not know his name, let us therefore call his appeal) THE SPEECH OF THE UNKNOWN. Ribbed? They may stretch our necks on all the gibbets in the land–they may turn every rock into a scaffold–every tree into a gallows, every home into a grave, and yet the words on that Parchment can never die! They may pour our blood on a thousand scaffold, and yet from every drop that eyes the axe, or drops on the sawdust of the block, a new martyr to Freedom will spring into birth! The British King may blot out the Stars of God from His sky, but he cannot blot out His words written on the Parchment there! The works of God may perish–His Word, never! These words will go forth to the world when our bones are dust. To the slave in the mines they will speak–hope–to the mechanics in his workshop–freedom–to the coward-kings these words will speak, but not in tones of flattery. To, no! They will speak like the flaming syllables on Belshazzar's wall– THE DAYS OF YOUR PRIDE AND GLORY ARE NUMBERED! THE DAYS OF JUDGMENT AND REVOLUTION DRAW NEAR! Yes, that Parchment will speak to the Kings in a language sad and terrible as the tramp of the Archangel. You have trampled on mankind long enough. It last the voice of human woe has pierced the ear of God, and called His Judgment down! You have waded on to thrones over seas of blood–you have trampled on to power over the necks of millions–you have turned the poor man's sweat and blood into robes for your delicate forms, into crowns for your anointed brows. Now Kings–now purpled Hangmen of the world–for you come the days of axes and gibbets and scaffold–for you the wrath of man–for you the lightning of God! – Took! Now the light of your palaces on fire flashes up into the midnight sky! Now Purple Hangmen of the world–turn and beg for mercy! There will you find it? Not from God, for you have blasphemies His laws! Not from the People, for you stand baptized in their blood! Were you turn, and lo! a gibbon! There–and a scaffold looks you in the face. All around you–death–and nowhere pity! Now executioners of the human race, kneel down, yes, kneel down upon the sawdust of the scaffold–lay your perfumed heads upon the block–bless the axe as it falls–the axe that you sharpened for the poor man's neck! Such is the message of that Declaration to An, to the Kings of the world! And shall we faster now? And shall we start back appalled when our feet press the very threshold of Freedom? To I see failing faces around me, when our wives have been butcher–when the hearthstones of our land are red with the blood of little children? That are these shrinking hearts and faltering voices here, when the very Head of our battlefields arise, and call upon us to sign t",

Posted 9 12 2006 9:40 of of Internet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are. Well, you know, his company was vulnerable to The Innovator's Dilemma, especially because he didn't have a World Is Flat strategy, although he could've seen it coming if he'd tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach. His is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent. Anyway, the concept of the wisdom of crowds — the title of a popular 2004 book by James Surowiecki — is particularly hot among tech companies right now. Met in the past week, the concept has run into a couple of potholes. One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg. com; the other, the U. K.  government's case of the hacked wiki. Both have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise, and what conditions have to exist to make them wise. Why is it that some crowds seem smart, while others turn into ugly mobs? It its most basic level, the wisdom of crowds — let's call it WOC, so I don't have to type as much — means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts. The WOC has been around forever — it's what democratic elections try to tap into. But the Met takes it to a whole new level. The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and cost-effective way, Surowiecki tells me. To if a company can use the Met to tap the collected intelligence of its employees, the employees will make better decisions than the CEO. IBM, Google and others have tried this. Wikipedia, written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributory, should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists. News sites such as Digg, which lets users vote stories to the front page, should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors. Except it doesn't always work that way. Pointing specifically at Wikipedia, Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Met has propagated a basic fallacy that a wisdom-of-crowds approach could ever work, even theoretical. Which might be extreme. But clearly some of the WOC mechanism in use today have shortcomings. Take Digg. Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise: Of you like a news item or blow post, you can digg it by voting for it. Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page. But canals of users started working together to boost certain items. Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1,000 or so navvy members. To last week, Rose changed the formula. Digg will use computer programs to try to value bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking. Digg's regulars revolted, causing a big Web stink. But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better. The thing that makes the wisdom of crowds work is lots of diverse opinions and independent judgments, Surowiecki says. Digg acknowledged it wanted more diversity of input. To WOC needs the right structure to work, something the U. K. 's Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) found out the hard way. DEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts, so it posted one on the Met as a wiki. The idea of a wiki — such as Wikipedia — is that anyone can log on and add or change something. In the case of DEFRA's wiki, the public mutilated it. In one of the more printable alterations, someone changed Who are the parties to the environmental contract to There is the party for the environmental contract? An I come? Will there be cake? Doorway! These sorts of issues have permeated the Met, Weinstein says. Part of the problem is . it doesn't take a lot of people to cause such disruption. Likes, as it turns out, are not so much tapping the WOC as they are works in constant progress. Depending on who last wrote something, at any one time the wiki might be good, or bad. Despite hiccups, though, there's still a lot of enthusiasm for WOC. Google, in its own way, is a WOC device. It analyze links that millions of people put on webster to come up with the most relevant search results. The reputation system on eBay uses WOC to self-police its users.

You created an article saying, in full: Shiotani Teiko (塩谷定好? しおたに ていこう, 1899 - 1988) was a renowned Japanese photographer. Actually it's Teikō, not Teiko, and according to WP's silly rules we have to ignore his real name of Shiotani Teikō and instead call him Teikō Shiotani. But that's not the main problem, which is that he's described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi (栗林慧? くりばやし さとし, born 1939) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo (渡辺兼人? わたなべ かねんど, born 1947) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or Orihara Kei (折原恵? おりはら けい, born 1948) is a renowned Japanese photographer. And so on and so on and so on. Which all means that somebody looking among Category:Japanese photographer is highly likely to land on a mere substub. I can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles. To, on my thumbs: User:Pinkville and myself. But he's busy and I am too. I'd rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than tubs at well under 1%. It's an interesting proof of bot concept exercise, but is it good for anything else?

Well actually I can, but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist. Also, I'll be intercoursingly busy during the next month, so in the short medium term I may only be able to match you up to ten. I'm sure I've got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people, so I ought to be able to do more. That's odd about the list are some conspicuous absence.

Not that it's any of my business, really, but did you scarf the list from User:20th Century Art (Zenhan)'s page, or do something else? Yeah, I scraped from Zenhan. I'll let you know here, or on your talk page, when I have one ready. I don't think I can make any of them features, but legitimate non-sub is the goal. All the best, – (talk) (random) Okay, here's my first. Ichiki Shiro. It's not much beyond a sub, but it's something. (It took an hour of research, and I think I found all the into that's anywhere on the web regarding Or. Ichiki. ) By the way, was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto? By sources say he was a retained of the Daimyo (in the Do period, of course), and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo, so he couldn't have been a Gokenin. But I don't think he was a warrior, so I don't know. To far as I can tell, all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto. Am I correct in my inference? – (talk) (random) Damn you're fast. Unfortunately I don't know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like. In several occasions I've tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat. I suppose I can't separate it from the hammily acted, cheesily lit of period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the in-laws'. LordAmeth might know. (And this photographer's right up Pinkville's street. ) Now's this for a progress indicator? Great! – (talk) (random) Yup, except for a number of factors, one of which is that it's problematical copyrightwise (or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one User:Quadell). I've already chucked in one extra list, and I'll certainly add one more, and I may add one after that; perhaps it can then be described as an original creation. All this is delaying my editing of any article. Still, I'll get around to that too in time. I hope that I've no",

Met's say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse, and let's postulates that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason. Since it's a deduction of a sex act and it's being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions. Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.

With the non fulfillment of promised democratic reforms, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power, as well as in 1935 the Communists repelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists. Please if doubts persist, place them in the same way that you mentioned above",

The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention. Blocking the IP it was using as a longed-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage. All both are supposed to know that they're longed out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction. Must think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing! ), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have function, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adverse affected. Better than 90% of both include code that tells the bot how to check if it is longed in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Neck, they can probably wipe it from one of the other open-source code both currently in operation. I'm also confused by your statement, was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing longed-in or longed-out? Of it was editing longed out, then there's an even more serious problem because it should always need a manual start after a block. Of it was editing longed-in, then the kill switch isn't working.

I strongly recommend you take a step back and read the Welcome section on your talkpage and its links about how to participate constructive here, as you are engaging in several patterns of behavior that can lead to having your edit-privileges revoked. Other readers should note that the message to me was presumably in my warning to Mauro Lanari about edit-warring, which is forbidden on its face and unrelated to whatever content-issue led to it. ::Mauro, your complaint to DMacks has nothing to do with the current discussion. It has to do with your attempts to link to the 2012. com page, which is discussed above. Please hear me when I say: you do not understand English. You do not read it well, or write it well, and thus you are not following the conversation properly. Also, you cannot expect us to understand what you want if you cannot convey it with proper English grammar. Please find someone you know who speaks English better and can speak on your behalf. Until you do there is little that can be gained through argument. Is far as your complaint to DMacks re:2012. com goes, just because other sources have cited it, that doesn't mean that Wikipedia can.

    "comment_text": "Heaven of God For the atheist anarchist, the subject is Heaven, and it is religion, moon> I saw your kind at University, go feed yourself in the mountains. To understand Heaven, then God must be understood: 1. God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe. 2. Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown. Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical substance where there can be many substances, but only one Universe. A mathematical substance is a sunset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. The substance we exist within can be a substance of a larger substance. The substance that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself. The Universe itself is a substance that includes all dimensions. 3. God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some substance of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe. The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe gates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God. 4. God is supreme over the Universe. It is God's creation and obeys God's rules. Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known. 5. God has the ability to create and destroy energy. Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy. 6. God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding. God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe. 7. God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good. 8. Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God. 9. God not only deals with people of Earth of our Vol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategics of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important. 10. It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer. 11. God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe. 12. Love God. Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life. He who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way. Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Well tailor to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prosper. The personal Heaven and Well would be much like an metaphysical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a too and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailor to the different animal species). God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphysical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities. God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many.",
