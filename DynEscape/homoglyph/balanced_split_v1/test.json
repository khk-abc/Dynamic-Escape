Any faces of fascia, communism and socialism are similar, but they are on exact opposite sides of the political spectrum (extrme right versus extrme left). When you can figure out what makes somethign a dentist ideology verus a right wing ideology, you'll have made your first step towards a quasi-enlightenment when it comes to poli-sci.

It should not have been determined by the wider membership a vast of majority of whom are not even in elected office. Second of all he decided to take on the leadership so soon after the party's 1997 defeat. Politically it would have been wise for him to have let the more experienced Ken Clarke become leader and waited things out. Of he had waited then he and not David Cameron would be leader now.

It is a a diploe with Russo-septic interests—and since Mauco has branded me a partisan, I'll identify that as my partisanship. I do not see this as an ethnic struggle for self-determination of Ukranians and Russians from Moldovans. I see it as a naked Russian power play (and not the only such one currently) to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial suffer advantage against NATO expansion. Regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets, no impartial observer—and certainly no Russo-septic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as, minimal: the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thus who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, and Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacated the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and rare all arms depot to the ground. When that happens, and people then dance in the streets, then I will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine. You keep talking about the parliament's opposition to Smirnov. Is a Russo-septic, I will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action, my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some elections which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. He can seriously discuss the will of the people:after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depot demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become citizens of the PMR, either;after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); andafter Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians. When we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation. I have the patience to wait for that discussion, do you?

But it's not the problem criterion for SoP - for SoP the problem criterion is the control of populated territory (e. g.  ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there). For example on p10 11 of the source: has a government. have a legislative body. have a judicary. have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will. - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation control. All other criterion are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criterion depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is peace loving, whether SoP is able and willing to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations the problem criterion is whether it's really a state (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's able to carry out the obligations (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2 3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc. )To you insist on adding such of SYN unsourced analysis?

You cannot see my computer settings or know that even with them set to empty, I also mentally empty the ache and everything else each time I close explorer which is very very often, so that little fairy story you just spun, goes nowhere. Internal ache reload my nellie. Is there a disneyland article here? Now about you apologise to all who come here for that futher failed attempt at trying to cause nonsense. Of you are an admin, then time to retire perhaps, or to go be retained. Now about you take your block tools, go find a quite contemplative spot, lock yourself into it and spare contributers here the nonsense as its canal, boring and totally and utterly immature. I do not need you handing out this wrong advice you seem duty bound to hand out spinning totally incorrect possible (to an old rperson - is that ages? ) and then threatning punishment if I dont bend to your possible delusions. Your behaviour here isnt helping a thing, and here is about putting information on this article not how great you or any other tool holder is, believe it or not. These antics make it sound more DOMish each time the boss stuff is tried. There is maybe a leather room down the hall so try there perhaps as its not appropriate stuff for here. To learn some manners instead of trying to spin me ridiculous parties about ache etc when you have no idea what my ache does or doesnt. Of you use your stupid tools hope u get yr jolies off them. All you will get this end is total disdain for trying that ache story on. To be a pest elsewhere instead of trying to stir here up again when its now not too disruption. There are some bizarre ratbags on wik. Its incredible but probably par for the course also. For someone who has been online for many many years, its not new though the pompous pleasing is.",

That's what the link is for - you can see his name is a link, and if somebody cared to read more, they can follow the article link. I have also expanded the section on Prank Calls, which is where the references to Or. Deutsch should be in. I think that this: Moe is frequently the victim of prank double entendre telephone calls from Bart Simpson, often followed by a violent threat of vengeance from Moe. These prank calls were inspired by the Tube Bar prank calls, a series of prank calls placed in the mid-1970s. The two callers, John Elmo and Jim Davidson, made similar calls to the owner of the Tube Bar. After Deutsch realized that the call was a joke, he would pew out a series of profundity-laced threats. The recording of these calls were widely circulated in the 1980s and 90s. is enough about the guy to give somebody a taste, and if they are interested, there are now 3 links to follow - Louis Red Deutsch, Tube Bar, and Tube Bar prank calls.

The Federal deficit in Reagan's final budget fell to 2. 9% of GDP. en. wikipedia. org wiki ReaganomicsAlso according to wikipedia it was increased borrowing, not increased spending, that lead to Reagan deficit: as a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.

Of it is relevant and integral to the article, in it should go, but as far as I can make out, it is not integral to this article, but to the fraccing issue in general. Is such it should go into fraccing articles, and though it might well rate a mention in this article, all such a mention should comprise is that there are concerns and controversies on fraccing safety and desirability, with links to the most relevant fraccing articles. Of you think that those articles do not mention the drinking water issues in sufficient detail and balance, go to the fraccing articles to make up the deficiency, not here. Otherwise we finally wind up with a separate (and very likely conflicting) fraccing discussion in every drinking water article for every major community in the Eastern US. And each of those will need its own dating and reconciliation etc. In short: a mess. Mention fraccing by all means. But do not explain, argue or enlarge at all in this article. Of you want to expound, feel welcome, but do it in articles where it will be appreciated. The principle has nothing to do with fraccing as such; it has to do with decent construction of articles.

I also recall Mick Foley mentioning that he has an “Attitude” version of the old WWF title in his closet. In the case with Hogan, he might actually have the real WCW title in his possession. He is only the greatest “Sports Entertainer” ever. I do mean ever! However, I’m talking about the title, not the belt.

Within the COMBINATION of air time he received in those two moves, he's still a minor character by far. Must because the character is popularized for younger audiences, people tend to forget the fact that people like Broly are seriously not important or essential to the manga or even the plot. A saibaman plays a larger role than Broly and that's an understatement. Of you want to help me, you can help me maintain control of the movie character pages, which are seriously becoming overcrowded with garage and fan perspective with every little detail since they only appear in 1-2 moves max. -",

He wants to do anything he can to push this POV despite being told by 3 admins that he is WRONG. :Why don't you get a screenname? ::I don't like to give out my email to anyone. Regarding three, admins don't carry any additional weight in concensus they only keep things civil and within policy.",

It is a rank weaker than the Co-Founder, Co-Ordinator, 2nd In Command and many others that arrive before me. Please let me know. Also, I have a problem with this Marcus2 in the Powerpuff Girls Talk Age. Not only me but also Rattis1 and probably some other users don't like him because he always delete quite important resources and ones that is known as comments like the Powerpuff Girls won the Friday Premiers or something like that. —Preceding signed comment added by (talk • contribs) 09:00, August 27, 2007 (UTC) The ranks aren't really indicative of any power and only really serve to indicate who organises the project at the top level, otherwise it's fairly meaningless. You can join but you won't be appointed any title as it's a level playing field here. As for the going issue with Talk:The Powerpuff Girls, I've been watching and noticing the edit war you have with to me and the information about the rating and demographics could be shortened as the article comes across as fairly one-sided and fanboyish with such into. You need arbitration but moreso need to get a consensus on nobility and push the quality up so it can be opened correctly at Peer Review which many of articles will be undergoing from B-Glass down. Thanks for your enquiry though, hopefully this helped and if you require more help you can ask User Talk:Yngvarr who has a good record for helpfulness. talk I'll take your words. Since you said that Marcus2 was right about the Cultural References thing, then I'll just let it go if he comes back. Thanks for your assitance Treelo. I'll try my best to make Wikipedia a peaceful place. I learned that I don't really need a rank after all. I should just, like I said, keep Wikipedia peaceful, that's all. Thanks again Treelo, I appreciate your opinion and comments. I'll try my best to completely follow the rules from now on. Alert me if you want to if you noticed me bearking one of the rules again then I'll change that habit As Soon As Possible. Thanks again. —Preceding signed comment added by (talk • contribs) An you help me on this, please? Since you're another one of the people who have worked for Iggy Arbuckle's article, I've asked you for help on this matter, along with the others. I'm trying to find out where I can go to ask the administrators for help on unloading images to the article mentioned, but I have had no such luck so far. Of you can give me the proper directions, please drop them off at my talkpage. Thank you very much! I see. Well, I suppose the only remaining problem is that it's dark hard to find available images of the characters in the show. Not any suggestions? List of characters from My Gym Partner's a Monkey Why revert my last edit in the article? It's accordingly to the episode I've seen. Didn't get a chance to explain but here's why, I delete it because it's only been reference once and only for comic effect rather than a standing fact. It might seem important to you but read as meaningless cruft to me as it's unlikely anyone would even notice had you not mentioned it. Remember, the articles are not for the more rabid fan to go and document every event in their favourite show, they're there for people who have never seen the show and want into on the subject. talk == Your",

Second, the theme of outback gothic has been assembled for no reason because it listed a couple of less famous films. I took a look at the only situation in the reinstated text, and I see a key problem - it doesn't support the text in the article. The source doesn't support the sentence A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape. , it doesn't use the term outback gothic, and doesn't mention most of the quoted films, such as Wake in Fright, The Cars That Ate Paris, Shame etc etc. In fac the only sentence which the source supoprts is the one that was already in the article before the edit was made: Saw (2004) and Wolf Creek (2005) are created with the revival of Australian horror. For now I am reverting the edit. Of someone has some reliable sources, then further revisions may be warranted, bearing in mind that one of the issues that a couple of us editing this article have been concerned about is its great length, which is contributed to by long lists of stuff, and minor material.",

His primary reference for product integral is Dollard and Friedman, Product Integrals, Addison Wesley, 1979, and it seems like a lot of the paper is extending their formality to the supersymmetric case. And that's fine, but it doesn't answer the question of nobility of Grossman and Katz's work. He doesn't mention them once; nor does he seem to use any of their ideas.

The new millenium was celebrated across the world on midnight of December 31st 1999 January 1st 2000. In reality there probably should have been a year 0 (0 is as much a number as any other number), meaning the current year should be 2009. In the same way an hour does not start one second after a minute, a millennium does not start one year after a decade. It midnight 31st December 1999, every degree of time changed, so there was new second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade. Why should millennium be any different. seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years and decades do not have a 0 value, eg seconds mins hrs is 1-59, days is 1-365, months is 1-21 and years start at 1, so everything that started at 1 changed to a new degree of time, therefore is makes sense that both decades and milleniums (which also both start at 1 not 0) would also start anew. It is only logical to have the discrepancy 2000-ish years ago(that fact there is no year 0) , rather than in the present which affects the people who are alive.",

I also had a look at your Talk:Arindam Chaudhuri#Its and sources on the talk page. I understand your point about not relying on primary sources for BLP articles. However, I have a couple of comments: # The passage that I added includes at least one source (the New Yorker article) that is definitely not a primary source. I feel that this source alone justified a mention of this case in the article. # Her of:BLPPRIMARY There primary-source material has been discussed by a reliable secondary source, it may be acceptable to rely on it to augment the secondary source, subject to the restrictions of this policy, no original research, and the other pouring policies. Also, per of:PSTS, we can use a primary source as long as we do not base articles and material entirely on it, and as long as we're using it only to make straightforward, descriptive statements. Thus, in conjunction with the secondary source mentioned above, I feel the use of primary sources is justified. # Siddhartha Deb's book has actually been published now, although maybe not in India. Fortunately, I have access to an academic library and should soon be able to borrow a copy myself. It this point, I'm a bit confused on the status of biographical books, whether they should be considered as primary or secondary sources. I'd like to hear your view on this.

I know you were probably trying to avoid making a personal judgment yourself, but by not making your views clear on this (i. e. , 'I personally don't believe you are a dick'; or, 'I believe this would be the right thing to do') you made your views clear by omission. It's really hard to blame user 66 for suddenly being upset with you. Did not the Buddha say, When they meet a sorrowful man, they should lament the bitterness of this ever-changing world? User 66 is clearly confused and sorrowful about Wiki and was hoping for more of a constant in his advocate.

Of you are off Kanagawa in Sagami Bay, then Fuji San is to the northwest and Edo (Tokyo) is the to north northeast. The boats are moving to the southeast towards the coast of the Izu peninsula. Because of Fuji San's height above sea level and the reflectivity of snow you do not have to be due east of the mountain to observe a spectacular sun rise. Further confusing the issue, the Kanagawa in the title of the print does not refer to Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa Prefecture was established in 1876. Prior to that time, the easternmost part of what is now Kanagawa Prefecture was known as the Province of Musashi. The westernmost part was known as the province of Sagami. The title may refer to an area in Musashi Province near what is now the city of Yokohama. The problem with this is that you do not see waves of this size in the confined waters of Tokyo Bay. You are only going to see them in Sagami Bay which is consistent with the geography in the print. Perhaps Hokusai was exercising artistic license or perhaps he was interpreting something he had heard or been told.

Wilson's books, wherein he takes him to task re group selection:  ::Group selection isn’t widely accepted by revolutionists for several reasons. First, it’s not an efficient way to select for traits, like altruistic behavior, that are supposed to be detrimental to the individual but good for the group. Groups divide to form other groups much less often than organisms reproduce to form other organisms, so group selection for altruism would be unlikely to overrule the tendency of each group to quickly lose its altruists through natural selection favoring theaters. Further, we simply have little evidence that selection on groups has promoted the evolution of any trait. Finally, other, more plausible evolutionary forces, like direct selection on individuals for reciprocal support, could have made us prosocial. ::These reasons explain why only a few geologists, like Wilson and E.  O.  Wilson (no relation), advocate group selection as the evolutionary source of cooperation. :",

I went over to his webster, and was surprised to find some lyric that could only be construed as racism. I ordered a disk, from old, and got one from new, and it is quite clear the later years has been a hateful time for Rose. It's important not to let your own opinions ride through the entries, so I have added words such as detractors and critics, though Willmcw keeps adding niceties that make it seem as as if the whole of Rose's ouvre was happy go lucky. It is not, and so should be noted, this strange turn toward angry old man, with particular venom toward minorities. I have also noticed that this 'other' Steve Espinola has his own webster linked to Biff Rose's and therefore is probably what you call on here, a sockpuppet. the connection between the 'other' Espinosa and Willmcw is not as clear, though they seem to communicate with some regularity. I hope all who read this will check out Rose's music, old and new and his mulittude of webster, because the answers are inside his words and web presence.

Of you changed the log to Tux because I labelled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag. It the time I had changed it, several going discussions had indicated that copyright images and logs available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy.

To please stop changing it saying he's the nearest of the forms he's clearly not the nearest form he beats up Goku, Vegeta, and Majin Buu at the same time. He doesn't even get tired matter of fact he gets bored and waits for Goku to get up and starts fighting him again. —Preceding signed comment added by (talk • contribs) Except, you know, Kid Buu is not the strongest form of Buu. The Kaioshin stated Kid Buu is Majin Buu's original form, and he's at his most DANGEROUS like this, not the most powerful. There are many, many instances that outright prove that Super Buu and his various forms are more powerful than Kid Buu. Saying he beats up Goku, Vegeta and the nearest form of Majin Buu at the same time is hardly proof that Kid Buu is strongest. ANY version of Majin Buu save for possibly Fat Buu could have done that easily. In fact, Goku outright states that if he and Vegeta were to fight Super Buu while at their most powerful, they would die. Met, when Buu reverted back to his original Kid Buu form, they were no longer worried, and Goku KNEW he could defeat him on his own. Well, he and Vegeta even played rock, paper, scissors in order to decide who wiould fight him first. That's how afraid they were. Took, just because you like Kid Buu best doesn't mean he's the strongest. It was stated that Kid Buu is the most unpredicatable, violent and wild of all the forms. Why isn't that good enough for you? —Preceding signed comment added by  Sorry but I don't do favortism I tell it like it is. I took he time to watch the entire Kid Buu sage and he is clearly the strongest form. Of you would take the time and recall Goku begged Kid Buu to stong with his death ball attack and Kid Buu smiled because he knew Goku couldn't stop it. His just begins the fact that Goku couldn't beat Kid Buu by himself if he could have he would have turned Super Saiyan 3 and gave it his all to stop Kid Buu from blowing up the Earth. Also he even forced Goku to lose his Super Saiyan 3 transformation which caused Vegeta to step in and fight. He also caught the spirit bomb which had Gohan's, and all the other Z fighter including all the people of Earth and the Namekians. To matter how crazy you are if you can't deal with power it will overcome u which was not the case with Kid Buu he took is seriously and started pushing the bomb back. He would have succeeded if there had not been 1 wish left and Goku would have possibly been killed. To how about you watch over and over again and realize that Kid Buu is the strongest form, crazy doesn't give you the ability to beat people up it just means that you have no rational which he doesn't have but no matter how crazy you are if you don't have the power than you can't dish it out.

    "comment_text": " POV talk section moved POVi've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity temple lest i be reported for edit warring by humus. i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portal in the see also section. these links are more fitting than claiming this is part of the series on christianitythis article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff. a lengthy criticism section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section. the missionaries are taught to speak in hebrew (these people already went to hebrew school! ) and jfj is known to target vulnerable jews (oh really? ) and most of the funding comes from christians (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews? ) and the current leader is not jewish (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion. most come from based publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards. including these references is analogous to editing the buddhism article to say that all buddhists will burn in hell along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone webster. anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article. it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus every missionary movement is opposed by someone. Friend, your edit pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffle feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commits and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that NPOV Thanks for the friend, nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not. Please don't accuse me of pushing my delusions. Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that all mainstream jewish groups, including secular groups strongly oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who all the mainstream jewish groups are, and what degree of opposition is strong. An you really not see this simple truth? Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism. I outlined this above already. Statements like j4j approachs vulnerable jews are unabashed POV and tautological. Of anyone converts then its clear they were vulnerable to conversion, so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches vulnerable jews. It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposed this conversion. Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn? Yes. but who cares? To drug smugglers strongly oppose DEA agents coming along and bursting up their operations? but it would be silly to put it in an article. Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying. Still, I wouldn't be strongly opposed to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same. Compare this article to that of any other missionary group. In the article christianity is there a section labelled incompatibility with organism and a belief that is incompatible with organism and all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity? To we see incompatibility with catholicism in the protestant article? I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete. That are the further objections? Yes, the group may be called Jews for Jesus and that offend people, but what would you have them call themselves? Would Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish be better? They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet. They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus deceiving ipod owners into believing in jesus.

To, srsly, it ALREADY HAPPENED! Noah! TWICE in fact that I can recall off the top of my head just in the past 15 years! :I mean, hurr de durr, where were your stupid masses in NINETEEN NINETY SIX when Congress passed the CDA, the Communications Decency Act, which, by the way, was like 38 shades WORSE than this current bill you're all spastic and nothing over. :And make no mistake, Congress WILL pass it into law, they're getting a FIFTY SEVEN MILLION dollar bribe to do it, essentially. And they've no problems at all with that knowing that their big brother the Supreme Court will simply step in right afterwards and fix their epic fucking mess. they get to keep all that bribe money of course and the MPAA RIAA will be out FIFTY MILLION dollars. win-win all around! :They do this all the time, it's practically their job description, there's actually been a whole slew of these idiot laws in the past 25 years, every single one deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court within a year of their passing through Congress, usually due to lawsuit from the ACLU and or the EFF. :The last two major ones were the CDA, Communications Decency Act and the COPA, Children's Online Protection Act. His new bill is basically the exact same thing, just recorded slightly. Same old shit, different crony. :Honestly, I can't believe I'm the ONLY one to point this out! I mean, hello, 1996! Blue Ribbon Campaign? Surely I couldn't have been the ~only~ person online back in 1996! Tha'fawk. they sure are breeding you kiss stupid these days. :Mmmm, should probably mention, in the event that a really tucked up law does come to pass, it usually takes the Supreme Court about a year or so to completely boot fuck it. BUT, when they're sued they usually file injunctions and shit that prevent them from actually putting the law into effect at all. so even though the law could effectively be completely passed. yeah, that doesn't mean they can actually act on it. :It is pretty hilarious though, first it was decency, then it was won't someone think of the children? and now we've got scar pirates in the latest inclination, but it's all the *SAME* fawking bill, just slightly recorded and with new acronyms, CDA. COPA. and now SOPA.

Demiurge has decided, apparently by fiat, that my link to a forum on the subject of Bangor is not allowed. He has attemped to explain this as being a commercial site (if it was I think it would be a damn sight better looking! ) or a site of my personal creation. His latter is not only radiant on Demiurge's psychic powers to determine, but is also wrong. I can see no reason to remove the link and leave the council one intact. I would prefer removal of both to removal of either. To leave one side of the story represented and not the other is censorship, no matter what rationalisation Demiurge tries to place on it. There is a great deal of unhappiness in Bangor at the moment about the council's actions and accountability. It is not material which could be covered in a NPOV entry but I believe it certainly deserves a simple link to enable those people who are interested in the town to see that there is a forum for their grievances. His is all the more important since the local newpaper has been threatened with legal action by officers of the council for even printing the URL which I have linked in. Thus, there is a real freedom of speech issue here. I have not attempted to force this view into the article, part of which I wrote as well as taking and lifting one of the photographs for, but instead simply placed a link in the place put aside for links to Bangor-related sites. I require that some better defence of the removal of that link than Demiurge's personal opinion be presented. Of it is not, then I will simply keep adding it via promise for the forseeable future.",

Did Dylan (and the two others) find Christianity, or is it more correct to say that they experimented with Christianity? It almost seems as though one is penalized for experimentation. Should a Jew be cautious in checking out Christianity? That is the lesson that we gain from the goings on here. Dylan is not a convert to Christianity.

    "comment_text": " Re-Listing of evidence that Safavids were Turkic speakers Tajik, since you have ignored the numerous references which we bring, and constantly are trying to purge out the word Turkic from Safavid page, let me bring you some more summarized quotes. Any of these may be already on this talk page, it's just some people choose to ignore them and uphold their own POV: The establishment of the Gajar capital in Tehran at the end of the eighteenth century was merely the last manifestation of what may well be a permanent tendency in the life of Iran. There are manifold reason of this phenomenon. Moreover, the Turkish and Mongol origins of the earliest dynasties certainly played a major part in causing the capitals to be situated in the north, and especially along the main invasion route following Alburz into Azarbaijan. The princes of these basically nomadic states were anxious both to be near their tribes and to avoid the excessive heat of the climate farther to the south. His helps to explain the evolution of Tabriz, which, despite all the vicissitudes, was the capital successively of the Mongols, the Qara Qoyunlu, the Aq Qoyunlu, and finally the Safavids, all of whom stemmed originally from the Turkmen tribes of the north-west from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. Tabriz was abandoned only for short periods, and always for other cities in the same region: Maragheh, whose, fertile pasture land had attracted Hulagu, Ardabil, the cradle of the Safavids; and Sultaniyeh. The Cambridge History of Iran (in eight Volumes). Volume 1. The Land of Iran. Edited by W. B. Fisher, Cambridge at the University Press, 1968. Page 434. The origins of the Safavids are clouded in obscurity. They may have been of Kurdish origin (see R.  Savory, Iran Under the Safavids, 1980, p.  2; R.  Matthee, Safavid Dynasty at iranica. com ), but for all practical purposes they were Turkish-speaking and Turkified. Their anonymous ancestor, Safi-al-Din (1252-1334), was a disciple of Shaikh Zahed of Gilan, a Sunnite Sufi pir or spiritual leader. Safi-al-Din succeeded his pir and settled in Ardabil in eastern Azerbaijan, and founded the Safavid Order. He was buried there, and his tomb and the citybecame a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. In the course of time and under the leadership of Safi-al-Din's descendants, the order became a militant Shiite one, with golat or extremist features, receiving support from Turkish and Turkmen tribes in Azerbaijan and eastern Anatolia, such as the Shamlu, Ostajlu, Takallu, D¨u'l-Qadr, Qajar, and Afshar tribes, who had strong devotional ties to the heads of the Order. The oldest poet of Azeri literature known so far (and indubitably of Azeri, not East Anatolian or Khorasani, origin) is Emad-al-din Nasimi (about 1369 – 1404, q. v. ). Other important Azeri poets were Shah Esma'il Safawi Khata'i (1487 – 1524) and Fozuli (about 1494 – 1556,q. v. ), an outstanding Azeri poet. During 17th – 20th centuries a rich Azeri literature continued to flourish, but classical Persian exercised great influence on the language and literary expression. In the other hand, many Azeri words (about 1. 200) entered Persian (still more in Kurdish), since Iran was governed mostly by Azeri-speaking rulers and soldiers since 16th century (Doerfer, 1963-75); these loanwords refer mainly to administration, titles and conduct of war. Shah Abbas II (r.  1052 – 77  1642 – 66 q. v. ) was himself a poet, writing Turkic verse with the pen name of And. The Hands were an Iranian people, and their decades of dominance were one of the few periods, between the arrival of the Saljūqs and the twentieth century, during which effective political power was exercised by a dynasty that can be regarded as in some sense technically Persian. David Morgan. Medieval Persia, 1040-1797 (History of the Near East) ISBN: 0582493242 With the exception of some very local dynasties, the Hands were the only Iranian dynasty that had come to power since the Buyids in the 10th century. The Azeri Turks are Shiites and were founders of the Safavid dynasty. Thanks.",

I agree that this issue shouldn't be discussed in depth, but the issue of gene is an important one, and as such I think it is important to come to an agreement on what the gene gospel is. I could cite sources on this, but I will just say that the best definition of the gospel gene I have seen is that it is a broad and difficult to define gene that includes elements of biography, historiography, and theology. I think we can all agree that it includes elements of these, so I think we should just go with this and not focus too much on this issue.",

However, I do think that the quote is notable. The main evidence of this is Treasurer Swan's use of the word 'reckless' in the Laurie Oakes interview: :TREASURER: Well, the most important thing we've got to do from a national level is to show some leadership by the national Government which is to get rid of reckless spending. That's why we said during the campaign, we would make savings of $10 billion and that's why we've set ourselves the objective of making further savings through this budget process. You see, we are seeing almost daily evidence of reckless spending from the former government. Only yesterday Or Turnbull admitted that he increased a grant to a friend, five times, originally recommended to him at $2 million, and given to the recipient at $10 million. That era of reckless spending is over. He need a new era of fiscal discipline and that is what the Rudd Government is determined to put in place so we can play our role in tickling inflation and taking some of the pressure off the Reserve Bank. :(emphasis mine). His was an interview after the election, it is clear that the quote informed their immediate post-election policy; it was not a throw-away line. Swann says getting rid of reckless spending is the most important thing they had to do. (Actually, this might also be worth including in the Wayne Swan article).",

    "comment_text": " I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliable, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interview them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shutters and the number of shots fired. He have a couple of option for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. He'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources. I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photo. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and or scale the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound. There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an inside account to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk",

That the book says in a footnotes on the subject is Sulaiman al-Shaikh - The caricature artist Naji al-Ali - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arab, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection. While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son. In the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon. However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly. Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown. By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it. All the best, | Talk",

It is the Picasso hook from the Trocadero Museum; there is already a different Picasso hook in Prep 2. I snapped out the Thomas Thynne hook to make room, and moved the quickly fur teach to the end of the set. To it looked ike this:. that Jean Thurel (pictured) was a soldier in the French Regiment de Lorraine for more than 90 years? that Picasso said he discovered what painting was all about after seeing African art in the Paris Use d'Ethnographic du Trocadéro? that detailed drawings by French explorer Louis Delaporte guided the reconstruction of Pha That Luang, a major Buddhist temple in Laos? that the world has been divided into 11 constituencies for French residents overseas to vote in the 2012 legislative election? that Sam Stein won his first World Series of Poker bracelets at the 2011 World Series of Poker but his largest single-event prize was a result at the 2011 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure? that the vocal in the music of Nier are sung in versions of French, English, and Japanese after 1000 years of language drift? that conversation in a Paris cafe inspired the Surrealist sculpture Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure), consisting of a fur-covered teach, saucer and spoon?

Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? His is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary. i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be delete from wikipedia. IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very mean word. i belive that is majority true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog. BITCH ! —Preceding signed comment added by • ==etiology== The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning female of the dog of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that the converse is equally possible. The adj. Itchy was first seen in 1925. The verb meaning to complain in 1930. Slang Bitchen good is attended to the 1950's == proclaiming the word bitch == The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variant bitch maintains it's correct definition - female nine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is pig, dog, cow and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? Is far as I am concerned, there is nothing to reclaim as bitch simply means a female nine. It may be used as a decorative or description - that does not make it a profundity. It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women proclaiming the word bitch in the 90s? An anyone point to articles on this, etc. The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word bitch any more than it reclaim the word sinner. Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. An someone point to a source that lays out the argument about birches, fertility and patriarch more clearly? :He don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaim the word, for instance, The's a Pitch. ::References are fine just the name Missy Elliot got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned proclaiming the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women spurs more generally within hip-hop. Now relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word counting querolous, spiteful, and malicious can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch. :It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of lagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -  ::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like bitch for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the consolations of bitch are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it. ::However, I still don't see the point of reclamation, for if bitch were purged of contem",

However, almost all sources agree that, had the Italian Battleship and Cruisers remained at anchor, or had the Italian ships failed to make contact with the convoy, the British delivery of supplies would be completed according to schedule, namely, before sunrise. His disruption of the Royal Navy plans, along with the damage inflicted upon the escorting units, made the cargo ships an easy prey for the German and Italian topped-combers the morning after the battle. The only cargo ship to make Malta damaged by the bombs was the Talabot, largely overdue from the original timetable. All the other were hit in some degree by axis aircraft BEFORE reaching the harbour (not just Clan Campbell, which means that the Royal Navy was still responsible for the steamers fate), further hampering the escort effort to disembark the supplies in time. To, despite the remarkable skill of the British units to save the merchantment from an attacking Battleship, the naval engagement should be considered a marginal victory to the Italians. In the other hand, had the British deceived their enemy or in some way avoid major contact with the Italians and reached La Valetta at dark, yes, the Royal Navy success would be undesirable. 00:52 February 28 2007 (UTC",

I'm not alone believing this was not a case of outing, and making unbroken allegation of misconduct, in this case outing, is also a form of personal attack designed to undermine the other editor, and Offliner has been warned in the past not to file such vexatious claims. Offliner is a veteran of filing complaints on WP:of, and if this comes under WP:DIGWUREN (and Kuril Islands dispute seems to fall outside of the scope of that case being Eastern Europe), he should know that board would have been the more appropriate place to lodge that complaint, but perhaps he wouldn't have achieved the same result.

There's also quite a lot of oppinion here, reaching the neutrality policy. Wallis in particular was very impressed with Steve and a strong creative and social bond formed between the two. He was like nobody else I'd ever seen before, he was a fucking pirie! Wallis recalled. I remember sitting in this living room with this cross legged pirie, with his little beard, covered in velvet and dripping talismen, crucified and scarves and talking like nobody I'd ever seen before. I was completely and utterly mad about him from the moment I first saw him. (from personal interviews by the author). For his part, Wallis was (and still is) an exceptional lead guitarist very much in the virtuous mould, but with far too much energy to fall into the fretboard-bore category.",

However, in this case, I do believe secondary sources abound on the subject. Why not cite them.

Links to sister projects and external URLs are still the same blue as local links. * You can now open temples by double-clinking them or by selecting them and pressing . His also works for references, images, galleries, mathematical equations, and other nodes. * VisualEditor has been disabled for pages that were created as translations of other pages using the Translate extension (common at Meta and MediaWiki. org). Of a page has been marked for translation, you will see a warning if you try to edit it using VisualEditor. * When you try to edit protected pages with VisualEditor, the full protection notice and most recent log entry are displayed. Blocked users see the standard message for blocked users. * The developer fixed a bug that caused links on sub-pages to point to the wrong location. * The size-changing controls in the advanced settings section of the media or image diploe were simplifies further. VisualEditor's media diploe supports more image display style, like borderless images. * Of there is not enough space on your screen to display all of the tabes (for instance, if your brother window is too narrow), the second edit tax will now fold into the drop-down menu (where the  item is currently house). In the English Wikipedia, this moves the Edit beta tax into the menu; on most projects, it moves the  tax. His is only enabled in the default Sector skin, not for Monobook users. See this image for an example showing the  and  tabes after they moved into the drop-down menu. * After community requests, VisualEditor has been deployed as an opt-in feature at Meta and on the French Wikinews. Looking ahead: A new, locally controlled menu of situation temples will put situations immediately in front of users. You will soon be able to see the Table of Contents while editing. Support for upright image sizes (preferred for inaccessibility) is being developed. In-line language setting (dir=rtl) will be offered as a Beta Feature soon. Looking further out, the developer are also working on support for viewing and editing hidden HTML comments. It will be possible to unload images to Commons from inside VisualEditor. Of you have questions or suggestions for future improvements, or if you encounter problems, please let everyone know by posting a note at Wikipedia:VisualEditor Feedback or by joining the office hours on Monday, 19 May 2014 at 18:00 UTC. Of you'd like to get this on your own page, subscribe at Wikipedia:VisualEditor#Newsletter for English Wikipedia only or at meta:VisualEditor Newsletter for any project. Thank you!",

Yes Mr Mariner wrote about Nuku'alofa Fort as he was part of 'Ulukalala's forces that destroy the Nuku'alofa Fort. Mr Mariner book was published in 1817, nine years before Mr Thomas arrived and recorded events and developed the Old Tongan alphabet as shown with the Bible Old publish or how the old people say in Tongan, koe paaki motu'a. Mr Vason arrived with 10 missionaries from the London Missionary Society in 1797, he stayed in Tonga for four years where he recorded Mumui as King, Tuku'aho installation and murder, while staying with Mulikiha'amea he also recorded and describe the Mulikiha'amea's Household, the beginning of the Civil War and how Muliki Ha'amea was killed. Mr Vason book was first published in 1810 with later published edition. Nuku'alofa were recorded over the years before Tongan alphabet and to the modern Tongan alphabet as these:1797 published in 1810: Noogollefa by George Vason, first Missionary. 1817: Nioocalofa by William MarinerPost 1826: Nukualofa by Mr Thomas Old published document. 1842: Noukou-Alofa by Father Chevron, first Catholic Missionary. Post 1945: Nuku'alofa by the modern Tongan alphabet. Anacrossan claim is supported and she has to remember that Taufa’ahau was in Ha’apai as King and his first recorded to visit to Nuku’alofa by the Missionaries were in March 1827, Nuku’alofa were already recorded 17 years before when Vason’s book was published in 1810. The Samoan Story is quiet a new version to me again, I dont know as she doe not refer to any sources but must be fananga for our ears.",

Never in all of my years in academic (the better part of a decade) have I been drive to such patiently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia. While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day. By failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an reliable propaganda board. Your reputation for reliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v.  Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia. ”I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock.

His negative consolation was used in the describtion of the activities of a black youngster, who was doing the same thing as white people, while what these white people where doing was described with a word with a positive or at least neutral consolation: 'finding'.
