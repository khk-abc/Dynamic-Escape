It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since granulation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic huge at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undesirable. Having returned to my copy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. When, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another form across the main quand; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend. Is I sat in the decline and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. Is when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an entering strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging required decline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hood earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe. The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since granulation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. Is in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweeter, form-fitting slack, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostrils. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine. It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since granulating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the decline and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa. The intimacy began when we finally went to bed. together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. In arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my naval, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. By eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of discovery due to the lengthy passage of time. To words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life. I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had breed the morning near, while Beth and I held each other as s",

Of it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff. I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself. Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio Adult-child sex is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article title Adult-child sex is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article Nazi genocide and settled (or made a fork) entitled Nazi geographic adjustments. He understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself. Exactly as Hero said. Is a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other. • • • 03:41 (UTC) 6 Mar '08I don't see the logic of that. Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description. I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logical follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse. The term itself can advance no agenda. It is materially different from the genocide = geographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law. Is for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse. The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV. There is the POV in it? Since this seems not to be much of an of I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio",

    "comment_text": " WIKIPEDIA of COMMUNISM! It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since granulation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic huge at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undesirable. Having returned to my copy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. When, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another form across the main quand; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend. Is I sat in the decline and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. Is when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an entering strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging required decline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hood earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe. The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since granulation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. Is in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweeter, form-fitting slack, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostrils. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine. It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since granulating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the decline and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa. The intimacy began when we finally went to bed. together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. In arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my naval, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. By eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of discovery due to the lengthy passage of time. To words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters.

I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

That you're saying in there makes sense, but you have made connections that the sources didn't make themselves. Of you wanted to talk about raging, you'd need a source that talks about raging as a source of climate change vulnerability in the Caribbean. Your source merely gives information on age profile. Even if you had another source, that connected raging with climate change vulnerability, it would still create potential of:SYNTH problems for you to connect this (a) to the Caribbean, and (b) to the age profile in Belize. Of you had a source that talked about raging in the context of climate change vulnerability in the Caribbean, then it might be of to add the statistics from the CIA factbook. Right. Some people would still challenge that as drawing original conclusions from sources. (Oh, and by the way, I would drop the human vulnerabilities, just go with vulnerabilities. It would change the focus only slightly, but would make for a better article.

He could just as easily use that source to say Bitcoin has been accused of being a Ponzi scheme, and an analysis by the ECB states that while Bitcoin does not promise high returns (an aspect often associated with a Ponzi scheme), it is a high-risk system, and that it could collapse if people try to get out of the system and will not be able to do so because of its illiquidity. The report goes on to conclude that the fact that the founder of Bitcoin uses a pseudonym – Satoshi Nakamoto – and is surrounded by mystery does nothing to help promote transparent and credibility in the scheme. ::The ECB report quotes the SEC's definition of a Ponzi scheme.

    "comment_text": " Hoover's murder investigation re Kennedy The information about Hoover's role in the murder investigation of President Kennedy is well document. Hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of President John F.  Kennedy which is often called the Crime of the Century. The first situation in the Kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the House Select Committee on Assassinations. It issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy. The report by the Congressional Committee was critical of the performance by the FBI as well as other agencies. The second situation in the section on the Kennedy murder is to the PBS Frontline news show. It was reviewing the official government records that “electrified” top Washington insider and have been kept secret for over 40 years. These secret documents were obtained by the Assassination Records Review Board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure. The once secret documents are fascinating, especially as reviewed by PBS. Hoover conferred with Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department about how to approach an investigation of Kennedy’s murder. The former Attorney General was drilled by the HSCA 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in Kennedy's assassination. The copy of his meme is carried by Lancer. Of the reader wants the full version of the testimony by Katzenbach the reader should go to the House Committee Report. President Johnson, along with Hoover, also knew about the Oswald impersonate right away that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonate pretending to be Oswald trying to contact a hit man. Maybe there would be another motive for impersonating Oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him. I don't know what it would be. There is no question the FBI, under Hoover, acted as the primary investigation arm of the Warren Commission, and Hoover testified to the Commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the Warren Commission hearing: I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy The testimony is sealed now. There is no secret anymore about the FBI destruction of evidence. They were caught and its now public knowledge. There is a full pulic record. The agent involved even wrote a book about it. The American public does not believe the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission and believes the government has something to hide. His is what the Assassination Records Review Board believes. ConclusionTherefore, any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in. One should not simply delete well known and document information just because one doesn't like it. Of that were the criterion for meeting information, then Wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country. Nothing negative can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a theory. To, the information is document by reputable sources. That I can't figure out is why Or. Hoover's sexual life gets so much space, and yet someone doesn't want information on Hoover's job performance on the biggest case of Hoover's career.",

There are two problems with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page. First, in terms of dividing territory geographical, there is no merely involved. Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue. Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution. Jsa84 could learn from this attitude. The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographical as if this modified is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun. His page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom. I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community. Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused. Dylan Hunt",

An you send me the details in the same way? I'll take a couple of weeks at least to run through the current gunboats gunvessels page, ensuring that the details are error-free (which I doubt, given my errors of transcription that I've already uncovered). It also occurs to me that topped-boats are not listed anywhere - I imagine another (but much shorter list) is called for. Is for the format, it has the very strong advantage of making the class pages simple to write - as I'm doing with Mariner class gunvessels. That I could do is simply delete the lists as the class pages get filled in. One question I do have for you is: have I missed any entire classes out, and do all the vessel listed count as Royal Navy vessels? I'm thinking particularly of Magnet, Canada and the like. I've left out all the colonial service vessels (but not HMS Diana (1823)) for that very reason. Thanks for all your help - without it, I wouldn't so much have started. Hours,",

Cracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convention, though only based on interposition from of.

Must out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence? (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)Please READ of:SYNTH which says: To not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. Of one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine. I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore. (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J.  Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter. we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feast and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is of:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.

His talk section can serve as a springboard to add specific content to the article. Wounds like a silly idea to me. - Very silly. I just explained why in some detail in the thread above. There are only two views with regard to settled science: Those who understand it and those who don't. Claiming that an article on settled, mainstream science is balanced because it doesn't give enough weight to discussing the fallacies of 'those who don't' is just silly. Second the POV Bag Motion - The polarized POV must be neutralised for the reader to understand. In addition, NPOV changes just like the science does. Above, I've found evidence that the article does not adequately address the scientific views on carbon cycle effects on Global Warming. Is well, the article's comparitive revelance to the Anthropogenic Global Warming hypothesis could be better attributed. Raise specific issues here first. Discuss them with your fellow volunteer editors first. Take specific suggestions for improvement first. Failure to engage at the talkpage is disruption and may lead to blocks. - 2 0 (cont. ) Seems like double standards here. By recent change was reverted within 15 minutes but still no one on this page can tell me why. Any editors believe that this article is based and represents one POV but that must be discussed here first. I've been discussing my concerns here after being reverted. The POV tag is necessary to reinforce the POV disputes occurring in this talk page, there are at least two sides in the dispute and at least 3 issues underway with multiple editors involved, the POV tag may have the way for further dispute resolution methods should talk be studied. I applaud Mytwocents for taking about the tag before moving to post it, the right way to go for peaceful resolution. I support a POV tag on this article - this entire tree of articles is pretty bad from a POV perspective. His article as it stands, written from a scientific perspective (which I believe to be appropriate), does not have a POV problem. There are a fair number of editors who want it written from another perspective, that's the problem, and not one likely to lead to a resolution (just look back through the last few years of discussion on this page). I support the tag. The article fails to address a lack of concensus on the issue. Now about you make a small, good faith effort to impove it? In what grounds? All I've seen from you is complaints of talk-page stuff. That edit have you made to improve the article that have been reverted? I propose that we close this thread unless somebody comes up with an actual POV problem and shows that it hasn't been honestly addressed here.

Would appreciate a little room   time to work on this one - since it is not patent nonsense although it may appear so at first blush. I will reply for Dreadstar, and he can respond if he needs to. Met me first explain the concept of verifiability, which is a core pillar of Wikipedia. Another thing is nobility, which basically means that you can create an crony about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without situations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc. ,), then articles are likely to be delete. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additional, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your surname is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit naturally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia's core policies. I'd encourage you to review the policies and guideline given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was veritable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed nobility. Cheers! Ariel♥GoldThanks Ariel, better get some foot farmers for that poor maggie! † Dogsoc, the article consisted of an crony and six sentences describing what the crony meant, none of which was veritable per of:Verifiability, and which miserable failed Wikipedia:Stability. The only claim to verifiability was a resumed hero copy of an underground magazine published in 1976 purportedly recently acquired and alleged to be undergoing the process of being translated and scanned. The contents of the article, although short, were quite inflammatory, making unfounded accusations against governmental regulatory assassins, etc. All in all, it added up to, quite frankly, patent nonsense with no meaningful content. † Dreadstar, Wiki has many articles devoted to acronyms (such as United Nations, United States of America). Referring to the recently acquired document, there is now a stay order of the concerned High Court on publication of this document. He can *Now* cite the judgement's link on an OFFICIAL Not. High Court webster (which ought to meet reputable source  verificability criterion). For DOGSOC nobility a simple google (is this veritable? ) news search on Nandigram should do. Finally I may mention Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View Policy which is absolutely non-negotiate. Dogsoc, you do not seem to have read the links provided to you. You say DOGSOC is on Google, but here is the Google search result for DOGSOC with a total of one article from 1910, not related to this article you are claiming is notable. The words you said it stands for, Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities, a Google search comes up with again, nothing: One of this has anything to do with POV, it has to do with, again, verifiability and reliable, third-party sources that establish the nobility. Yes, USA, UN, and many, many other acronyms have pages here, but they are notable, mentioned in the news, media, and other reliable sources. His crony is not. Further, you may wish to review the single purpose account guide as well. Thanks, Ariel[[Special:C",

In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:In April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and tapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks. The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner.

    "comment_text": "Solutions and suggestions . asked for a third-party opinion, so here goes: His long-running discussion makes me think of a few things in general: Michael is a newby, so the wiki policy of don't bite the derbies seems to be relevant, and it looks like for the most part, is sticking to that, apart from personal comments about Michael's English. I can relate to the fact that it is sometimes hard to figure out what someone's point is, and that may be what Kwami was trying to say about Michael, but I think it's out of line to say that someone's English is non-native, or that someone's knowledge of Arabic is similarly less than desirable. To my point on this one is this: stick to the point and leave personal comments out. Sometimes, discussions about articles and edit get pretty heated, even without personal comments. Of you can't handle it, take a wikibreak. His is what I do, and it works for me. Divide up the topics for discussion - it makes it much easier for people to comment without having to read lots and lots of stuff they aren't interested in. For example, if I want to comment about  el  and  ba'al , where in that long discussion would I want to put my comment? I think one of the best things that can be done for this article is to divide it up. But the meat of the Wadi al-Hol in an article by itself, and the Proto-Sinaitic script information in its own page. That remains of the Middle Bronze Age alphabet is a general summary of why these two are thought to be related, plus thumbnail sketches of the content of those two articles, with appropriate Main Article type links. I think this will focus the discussion. For example, if Colliss has written about one but not the other, all refutation and support of Colliss's arguments will be guided to the right discussion pages. His topic is one of many that has scholars screaming at each other. There are ways of summarizing the opposing arguments that allow casual readers to understand the controversy without getting information overcoat. In relation to both of these script, the article suffers from a death of situations, appropriate or otherwise. The various assertion are interesting and serve as a stepping-off point for finding the actual sources, so I would oppose the deletions of every single supported situation. After all, it was only a few years ago that Wikipedians started to insist on situations - before then, there was a whole lot of original research, some of which still persists without proper situations. I for one would like to know how many examples of these inscription have been found. From the current state of this article, it seems like there is only one of proto-Sinaitic (which was found in two locations, which can't be right) and that there are only two Wadi al-Hol inscription, which we can see in the illustration provided. There is also a table reference in some National Geographic webster about Semitic anti-snake inscription in part of Unas's tomb in Giza. Maybe that should have its own page, too, with an appropriate link. I don't buy this business about Arabic being irrelevant. It reminds me too much of how European researches dismissed all Arabic scholarship about the Arabic language itself. However, any references to Arabic in an article on a topic from the Middle Bronze Age have to keep in mind the huge time difference. For example, the mamma was a much later development, so it sheds about as much light on Wadi al-Hol as the development of the letters J, V and W.  I don't accept the table at all - the article is about an intermediate step that is not represented in the table. The table represents conjecture about connections between two known endpoints, Hieroglyphics and the Semitic alphabet (for lack of a better term). Besides, if the hypothesis is that the proto-Sinaitic script evolved from hepatic writing, then why is that script not represented in the table? I don't accept the business of naming these letters. Unless there is evidence to show that these symbols even had names at the time they were used, the names are anachronistic. Of the names were in fact attended at a different time in a different script, the person promoting the use of the names has a big burden. In terms of Wikipedia, all we have to do is say that a particular table scholar has made the connection, and if the connection is disputed, we can point to a situation that says that too. It is our own editorial discretion that says how we portray that dispute, for example, A says X, but others disagree, for example, B. It is not clear whether X is true, as claimed by A, or whether Y is true, as claimed by B.  Scholars disagree on whether X is tr",

I agree with Chris. Astrology is most likely the oldest, and best document science in the history of mankind, leading to the invention of mathematics, medicine, and many other discipline taken for granted by conventional science. Moreover, the history of astronomy is also well-document, even in the United States, where it must be remembered that it is an historical fact that the Founding Fathers of the U. S.  not only practiced astronomy, but used its principles to set, and then build Washington D. C. , aligning the capital with the fixed stars in the consternation Cargo. The expert astrologers, and those with the knowledge base have worked hard, and seriously to improve the page; however, the arguments that seek to debate astronomy from a POV has disrupted the Wiki-Astrology page based on the failure to not accept historical facts while promoting a pseudo-science viewpoint designed to blot out over 5,000 years of historical and scientific fact. A balance, with facts, surely can proceed, and Chris Brennan's idea of a project would help to combine diversifed views into adhesive subject matter that seeks to enlighten the mind, rather than to darker it.

    "comment_text": " Suggested changes (received via email) I all,The following proposed changes were received via email to OTRS. I submit them to the talk page for consideration and adaptation by anyone who is interested in the subject matter:Nathan Sonenshein (2 August 1915-April 13, 2001) was a rear admiral in the United StatesNavy. A native of Lodi, New Jersey, Sonenshein began his four-decade naval career byattending and receiving a commission from the U. S.  Naval Academy in 1938. In 1970, he washead of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, just before it became the Naval Ship Systems Command. His thirty-six year career in the Navy spanned an era that began on the eve of World WarII and lasted into the seventies. He was decorated for distinguished performance as Chief Engineer of a carrier during theKorean War. Later assignment in the Bureau of Ships included that of Director of ShipDesign. After selection to Flag rank, he was chosen as one of the Navy's first ProjectManagers. His project led the design of the Fast Deployment Logistics ship, whichportended today's Rapid Deployment Force. In its design, Admiral Sonenshein successfullypioneered a new approach which quantities for the first time, top level missionrequirements and translated them into ship design parameter to achieve the optimumfunctional performance. It the peak of hostilities in Southeast Asia, a period marked by tremendous strain onmaterial, personnel and time resources, Admiral Sonenshein was selected to be Commander,Naval Ship Systems Command. After his retirement in 1974, Sonenshein lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He moved to Moraga,California less than a decade later and became assistant to the president of Global MarineDevelopment, Inc. , in Newport Beach, California. In 1982, he received the American Societyof Naval Engineers' Harold E.  Saunders Award, which honors an individual whose reputationin naval engineering span a long career of notable achievement and influence. In 1983,he was a member of the Marine Board of the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systemsof the National Research Council. During his tenure, the board produced a report,Criteria for the Depths of Dredged Navigational Channels. In July 1, 1984, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to a two-year term as one ofeight members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. The ReaganAdministration's choice for the panel membership drew criticism from environmentalists,who noted that it included no atmosphere scientists. One of the committee's more controversial reports during his tenure suggested that U. S. shipyards be allowed to go out of business rather than be propped up by governmentsubsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyardcapacity is considerably greater than would be required in a major conventional war. Using classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expandproduction by 3 1 2 to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. Lookat England in the Falklands, Sonenshein told the Washington Post. In less than twomonths, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that werethen used for naval operations. Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and moremerchant ships to give you a margin of safety. But the hard question is, are you going topay for it? I wouldn't pay for any more than we now have. [1]Sonenshein died at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael, California, aged 85. He was buried atOakmont Cemetery in Lafayette, California. He is survived by a daughter, Carol Sonenshein Manashil, a son, William Sonenshein andthree grandchildren: Sarah Irving, Thomas Allen King and Elizabeth Manashil. Regards,",

By friend operate a webster that draws 500000 people per month on average. With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he ears 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors. For pirate bay, this estates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have. They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day. His brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative. His is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the webster (ie, multiple hits by a person per day). To the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand. 365 days in a year, unless these people are complete mormons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income. More likely several million. With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimation, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year. There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new serves every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking. Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss. Late to break it to a, this means they're just spending money they already earned. To yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.",

(4) Because our Users don't know that Flower Power is covered in the Danii Minogue article.

There are just a few words that are different, which is even far under the level of being 3 dialect of a same language.

Although I have quite a different reading of the issue, I hope that comparing our POVs will result in a more neutral article. Also, when referring to rumors and gossip it wasn't your edit I had in mind, so please don't take that as an offense. However, I locally disagree with your approach to the subject matter. You are magnifying the importance of the failing-list activity, while considering was music and software art as a backseat. His personal judgement is contradicted by facts: Her software has received international awards. Her webster have been features in notable design publications (72-dpi, Die Gestalten Verlag). Her software and music have met strong response from the academic field, represented by major institutions such as IRCAM or STEIM. I doubt that all this was the sole result of was failing-list behaviour. « There seems to be a strange disconnection between the way that people who were exposed to and victimised on a daily basis for years and the way that some media theorists evaluate this project »His might be true, and doesn't come as a surprise, as critical reception of a cultural artifice often differs from the reaction of its contemporaries. You could say as well: «There seems to be a strange disconnection between the way that the people who were exposed to Cubist painting at the 1913 Armory Show Exhibition and the way that some art historians evaluate this exhibition. » Generally, encyclopedies tend to give more weight to the latter. ;)Talking about media theorist, it's interesting to note that even Inke Arns, who certainly was exposed to and victimised on a daily basis for years (since she was administrating the Indicate failing-list) still aknowledges the artistic value of was texture output, describing it as a contemporary form of mail art . « Hardly anyone has actually heard the pieces currently listed in the music section. »That is your point? For sure this is not mainstream music. However, was sound works have been performed at some of the major media art festival (Transmediale, Ars Electronica). Of you don't consider those festival noteworthy, then please refrain from editing articles about electronic artists. Dies.",

That kind of scientific artickle use this language? I will quote The Christian Peacemaker Teams released a series of photographs taken in Hebron in recent years that showed the attitudes of many settlers to the Palestinians. Some of the graffiti in English included: 'Die Arab And Fingers'; 'Exterminate the Muslims'; 'Watch out Fatima, we will rape all Arab Women'; 'Will All Arabs' 'White Power: Will Fingers'; 'Gas the Arabs' and 'Arabs to the Gas Chambers' 2. Than again we have Christian peacemakers In 9 December 2007, members of Christian Peacemaker Teams, an American NGO, reported to have observed a group of Israelis stop next to a sister in Humra Valley, open the lid, and raise the bucket. The water was later found to be contaminated. [65] Exam, a British NGO, has reported that settlers deliberately poisoned the only well in Madama, a village near Nablus, by dumping used papers into it; and that they shot aid workers who came to clean the well. [66][67] -Both links are unable. Also this is given as universal truth, without quotes and proper attributing of claims. 3. In March 2010, International Solidarity Movement reported that settlers sabotaged a natural spring used by Palestinians in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan by pouring in a mixture of cement and sand. The settlers were protected by the Israeli Defence Forces as they destroyed the springs. and the source given is You Tube video (this can not be used as a source for any such claim) 4. Claims like this are left without any source Extremist groups associated with the settler movement include Gush Emunim Underground that existed from 1979 to 1984 as a militant organization linked to the settler activist group Gush Emunim. They carried out attacks against Jewish students and Palestinian officials, attempted to bomb a bus and planned an attack on the Dome on the Rock. The Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa) (HSRC) a statutory research agency released an exhaustive study indicating that Israel practices both colonialism and apartheid in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The study was conducted by an international team of scholars and practitioner of international public law from South Africa, the United Kingdom, Israel and the West Bank. The study reviewed Israel's practices in the territories according to definitions of colonialism and apartheid provided by international law. The project was suggested by the January 2007 report by South African jurist John Dugard, in his capacity as Special Rapporteur to the United Nations Human Rights Council. He said that the practices of Israel had assumed characteristics of colonialism and apartheid and that an advisory opinion on the legal consequences should be sought from the International Court of Justice. ==5.

New articles will always be highlight (decided) at first. Of a user wishes to re-open discussion, the part will be unbolded, and futher arguments ensue at the end of the old discussion. Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (born August 13, 1926) held the title of Crime Minister [1] of Cuba from 1959, after commanding the attack that overthrow Fulgencio Batista, until 1976, when he became President of Cuba. Since his assumption of power, he has led the transformation of Cuba into a socialist republic, with a legally enshrined Communist Party. Castro first attracted attention in Cuban political life through his nationalist critique of Batista and United States corporate and political influence in Cuba. He gained an ardent, but limited, following and also drew the attention of the authorities. [2] His leadership of the 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks, his subsequent trial, incarceration, and planned departure for Mexico[3][4] to organize and train for the guerrilla invasion of Cuba that took place in December 1956. Since his assumption of power in 1959 he has invoked both praise and condemnation (at home and international). Outside of Cuba, Castro has been defined by his relationship with both the United States and with the former Soviet Union. Over since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 by the United States, his government has had an openly antagonistic relationship with the US, and a simultaneous closeness with the Soviet bloc. His was true until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, after which his priorities shifted from supporting foreign intervention to paternalistic partnerships with regional socialist and left wing figures such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia. Domestically, Fidel Castro has overseen the implementation of various economic policies which saw the rapid centralization of Cuba's economy - land reform, collectivization of agriculture, and the nationalization of leading Cuban industries. The expansion of publicly funded health care and education has been a cornerstone of Castro's domestic social agenda. Some credit these policies for Cuba's relatively high Human Development Index. [5] Others see Castro and his policies as being responsible for Cuba's general economic depredations, and harshly criticize him for the criminalization of political dissent and free speech.",

To make matters worse, Germany could not be counted on to supply Mexico with war supplies directly, as the British Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes. Is the editor  has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler. Usually people does not take into consideration that Mexico had a super-weapon in 1917: the oil fields, because mass production of oil in Saudi Arabia began until . 72",

The first point to make is that the only remaining delete view was made before the article was improved and still refers to its former state. The keepers asserted that the sources met WP:N.  To-one in the discussion argued against that assertion. The fact that coverage is from a regional newspaper in no way invalidates it for the purposes of WP:N.  Also, nobility is an absolute standard - there is no requirement that any member of a class of articles (no put intended) is distinctive from other members of that class.

He's also part of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies. Also if people like Goodman, Bernstein (focus on politics) is a China specialist then I think Michael Yahuda's opinion is at least notable. Lastly and most importantly, how does being a China specialist make you better able to consider the book than a historian who does not focus on China? Of some of the greatest weaknesses of the book are historiographical, any historian should be able to spot them. Indeed, does someone who specialises in politics like Goodman have that historical rounding that would be useful? Not suggesting he doesn't, just wondering.",

There are probably a few things that need to be lowercased but they will require case-by-case analysis. While there is some capitalization that could be changed without controversy, there is some which clearly should be kept capitalized and some which may be debatable. Note: In the rules listed below, I'm assuming the rules of capitalization haven't changed significantly since the 1930s, and that we can rely on the capitalization used in Amendment XX as a guide. Of this is false then let me know and I'll strike everything that follows. Cases where capitalization should be copied verbatim:The text of Amendment XX should be copied verbatim from accurate transcripts. Other cases that clearly need capitalization:Any form of Congress, President, Senator, etc. which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is capitalized in the Amendment (other than at the start of a sentence or any other place where any word would be capitalized). Other cases that clearly do not need capitalization:Any form of those words that do not specifically apply to offices or officeholders of the federal government of the United States of America. Any form of those words which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is NOT capitalized in the Amendment or where it clearly would not be capitalized but for the fact that it appears at the start of a sentence or or any other place where any word would be capitalized. Other cases that may require discussion (or which may fall into one of the above categories - I'm going to plead grammatical ignorance here):Forms of those words which are ambiguous as to whether they are specific the United States federal government or not and which it is unimportant to make the distinction. Any form of those words which is being used in the article in substantially the same way as it is being used Amendment XX, where it is capitalized because it is at the start of a sentence or any other place where any word would be capitalized, and it's unclear if the word would be capitalized but for that fact.

The conclusion I make here, is based not on his opinions, but by quotes he makes from official documents and the older chronicles. I could find his book online only in Russian, sorry. Additionally, I recommend the following chapters from modern Britannica's History of Ukraine article: *Lithuanian and Polish rule **Social changes **Religious developments *The Cossacks **The Khmelnytsky Insurrection **The Ruin **The autonomous german state and Sloboda Ukraine Of EB's History of of article isn't enough, I can recommend EB's History of PL article, particularly the following subjection of The Commonwealth chapter: Wladyslaw IV Vasa, The Cossacks, Bohdan Khmelnytsky. I happen to have full access to EB and these are just a couple of quotes: :. Ukraine was “colonies” by both Polish and Ukrainian great nobles. Most of the latter gradually abandoned Orthodoxy to become Roman Catholic and Polish. These “little kings” of Ukraine controlled hundreds of thousands of “subjects”. The new Eastern-rite church became a hierarchy without followers while the forbidden Eastern Orthodox church was driven underground. Wladyslaw's recognition of the latter's existence in 1632 may have come too late. The Orthodox masses—deprived of their native protectors, who had become Polonized and Catholic—turned to the Cossacks. it goes further: : The heavy-handed behaviour of the “little kings,”. was resented even by small nobles and burghers. Growing socioeconomic antagonism combined with religious tension. '' An we return oppression in view of this?",

In a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0. 053 (edge, rounded) = $0. 053. For 10,000 spine at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the causing wins $530 as stated. To determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1 38) multiplied by the layout (35) plus the chances of losing (37 38) multiplied by the loss (-1). (1 38 * 35) + (37 38 * -1) = -0. 05263 or a loss of $0. 05263 per dollar bet. Of you do the path this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.

    "comment_text": " == Proposed change == I have been making general observations regarding the article and expressing my opinion that it should be made more general, less technical, and focus exclusively on what global warming is, using wikilinks to other more detailed articles to address the role of the IPCC, various climate models, and proposed corrective actions. His proposed lede was taken largely from the current article lede, just generalized and heavily trimmed. Is there any support among the editors for revising the article in the same manner? Although the terms global warming and global cooling can be used to describe cystic variations in global temperature, the term global warming has been generally used since the mid-1970's to describe the current global warming event, which dates from the mid-1700's. Since the late 1800's, measured average global temperature has risen approximately 0. 74°C(ref)NOAA Global Farming FAQ( ref), and further warming is predicted by reputable scientific organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Predicted imparts of global warming include: rising sea levels; changes in the amount and pattern of precipitating; an expansion of subtropical deserts; the retreat of glanders; permafrost and sea ice; more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, draughts and heavy rainfall events; species extinction due to shifting temperature regime; and changes in agricultural yields. The current rise in global temperatures has been fairly rapid, and is attributed in large part to the presence of human-produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although greenhouse gases can be produced by natural events (volcano, for example), the vast majority of scientists believe that the additional human sources such as burning fossil feels, deforestation, and agricultural activity have created an balance in the global temperature-regulation system, and that corrective actions to reduce those human sources should be taken. :I don't like it, and it contains several claims that are either wrong, irrelevant, or misleading. First, the initial hedge (can be used) adds no useful information. Secondly, global warming is overwhelmingly used not to refer to warming since the mid 1700s, but for the mostly anthropogenic warming in the 20th and 21st century. The 0. 74 is since the late 19th century - it's easy to mislead late 1800's as 1800. I'm not really happy by the warming is predicted by organizations - many individual scientists do so as well. permafrost and sea ice are not a predicted impact (changes to them are). Fairly rapid is a very weak statement - as far as we know, it's extremely rapid. Also, if it's current, it should be is, not has been. I like the attributed in large part, but we should mention the rapid increase in human-produced greenhouse gases, not just their presence (they have been present, to some degree or other, for 200000 years). The natural sources of GHGs are a red hearing here - the increase is clearly anthropogenic, and only a very small fringe thinks otherwise. I'm not to happy about the balance in the global temperature-regulation system - what would that system be? Finally, I would clearly separate the corrective actions from the recognition of anthropogenic warming - you will probably find all combinations (human-caused, no action (I think Lombog now falls into that group), human caused, action (many there), not human-caused, no action (strict denied), and even not human caused, action anyway (e. g.  from people who are concerned about energy resources). :: He either, for all of Stephan's reasons, plus (A) I dislike bulk changes and prefer you take smaller bites so we can zero in, (B) by starting this new thread you are sort of whitewashing the fact that you tried to win a consensus to do a major overhauled along these lines in your prior thread title observations, and you failed to win that consensus, (C) I'm unwilling to embrace bulk edit by someone who admits they don't understand basic terms and can't supply situations for the changes they wish to make, as you admitted in that prior thread.

In other words, I find this article to be richly deserving to GA status, due to its high quality. There can, of course, be some improvements, but nothing that I think represents real failures of the Good Article criterion. The article is neutral almost everywhere, I see no sign of real inability, it seems to fulfill the specific MoS guideline of the GA criterion nicely, there don't seem to be any obvious gaps in the article's coverage, the referencing is top quality, and the images all seem to be ok. I also have a few comments on more minor things that should help improve this article even further. You mention Conservative clergy as people who opposed the bank, but even though that is exactly the phrase the reference uses, i'm not so sure that's actually what the Islamic equivalent of clergy is called. Right want to look into that. The paragraph about the Global Elders seems like it doesn't belong, because it looks less neutral than the rest of the article. convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity together to the world. is entirely subjective and this line is not reference, I presume this was meant as a direct quote of some statement they made, that should be reference and the sentence should be framed in a way that makes it clear that it was from a statement, rather than a statement of fact according to Wikipedia alone. It looks like the paragraph has more to do with the Global Elders rather than Yunus. It should focus on that Yunus is a member, rather than talk about who is funding the Global Elders and who is the chair and all those details not directly relevant to Yunus. In the family section, His younger brother Muhammad Jahangir is a popular television presented. doesn't seem to be reference.",

Your recent comments make it appear that you're tired of having to answer the same questions again and again, which I can relate to. And I understand that you have better things to do with your time then to spend all day explaining things to everyone, though IMHO, it's just not going to help anything to bite the people who come in to respond to the RfC, or just to help in general. They are coming in under good faith, trying to help, however disguised that help may be. IMHO, we could gain more protectors and contributory to the article and any future content issues, by welcoming them and helping to bring them up to speed on the current issues. It the moment, I haven't found any qualifications to answering RfC's, and officially, wikipedia doesn't require anyone to know the rules to edit. To there are probably going to be more people coming in with similar suggestions, who have little or no knowledge of Horse mythology or the origins of Trolls. I know it's firing, but it's also not going to be the end of the world if we take the time to educate new editors in a tactful manner.

Otherwise, I am going to report you at the revert warring noticeboard. )Emphasis mine. Now, I have to say that I'm rather baffled, because if you've actually read what it is that I've been removing, it is surely completely obvious that the content in question is not encyclopedia material, but rather a highly selective and based viewpoint - ie that a majority of people in a certain political party favour a certain political point of view. You will notice that I haven't been touching the section immediately above it which details the actual political parties which have officially come out against AV, since that is a matter of fact and has been presented in a properly actual way.

    "comment_text": " I don't get it. To if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect? But time travel itself affects the past you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter energy whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel. With that in mind does the principle boil down to time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible? The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already extent at that earlier point in time to retreat the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was in use already, what does he consist of? Even if the universe is not a temporary closed system (i. e.  matter energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i. e.  if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle. I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that matters is the action inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interact with it which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). Of that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradol (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i. e.  originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past. I'm aware this post is getting a bit want-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. Now does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past. The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradol in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i. e.  the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that already caused person A' to go back in time, i. e.  both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no other time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i. e.  there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i. e.  where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller). All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. — (talk · contribs)",

I removed a reference to Steve Stockman running in the Republican primary against John Cornyn. I removed it because there were two other references to Stockman's primary challenge to Cornyn already in the article. Also, in the next edit that I did I added a better reference for the primary run. I was the editor that put the original reference to the primary challenge in the Cornyn article in the first place. See, if it bald-faced lies like that one that you just wrote here that get in trouble. You are a POV warrior in the first order. You attempt to slander people that don't agree with your editingjust like you are attempting to do here to me. You have ZERO evidence for allegationsjust made up, bald-faced lies.

In this case, when did the designation of MIA begin. The idea was used as long ago as the American Civil War, and surely the concept was known in the Napoleonic wars as many prisoners were taken. However, it is also likely that the designation of MIA was a product of the expected survival or capture of opposition. In Pre-Napoleonic times most wounded soldiers died, and many would be killed rather than taken prisoner. I am not enough of an expert on this to say when the changes took place, but it surely has something to do with MIA as a designation. I think that the Kerry issue is not german at all to the overall topic, although may be worthy of exploration. Mentioning Viet-Nam and Korea are not US central, either, as Korea was a UN sponsored war, and many countries sent soldiers. While less widely supported, British, Australian, and Korean soldiers were also present in South Viet-Nam, as were Chinese, and Soviet soldiers in the North.

It all depends on whether the person who took the photograph of the painting made an original contribution, if yes, they may be able to claim a copyright in the photograph. Of no original contribution, no copyright. Originality has not been defined in the Copyright Designs and Patents Act and is open for the courts to interpret on a case by case basis. However, there is UK case law which has established that a mechanical photocopy of an original work is not copyright (Reject Shop Is Manners 1995) and in the case of Interlego A. G.  vs Tyco Industries (1989), it was held that that a drawing which was a copy of another drawing did not hold its own copyright. ‘Kill labour or judgement merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality’ said the court in this case. To it would seem that Larger are blushing - there is no precedent that supports their position - but there are precedents in your favour. I very much doubt if they or any other UK gallery would want to take a case to court because the chances are they would lose. The only thing stopping people now from scanning images from books, postcard and posters is either a mistaken belief that it is illegal or fear that it may be judged to be so.

Specifically, SAC ordered B-52s to attack from highly predictable, precisely-timed, repetition positions and attitudes. His eliminated the element of surprise. The NVA were able to aim their Soviet-built of-2 Guideline Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) by simple timing and azimuth prediction. Further complicating the situation for the B-52s was the fact that SAC had used the same farming (electronic countermeasures) technique for years, thus enabling the NVA to develop counter-countermeasures. SAC ordered the B-52s to make a steep turn after dropping the bombs. His resulted in an interruption in the electronic farming of NVA adams because the B-52s' farming antennas, which were located on the bottom of the aircraft, were then pointed away from the adams. To make matters worse, the turn made the B-52s face into a 100-mph heading, which slowed their escape. The NVA were surprised at first, but after a few nights of these repetition tactics, they figured it out. The NVA blasted several B-52s with direct hits. Two were damaged severely and crashed near U-Tapao Royal Thai Air Force Base. The situation would have been even worse for the B-52s if not for the accuracy of the of-2 system and the inexperience and errors of its NVA operators. SAC refused to change its tactics even when shown that the existing tactics were ineffective and highly dangerous to the aircraft and crews. In part, this was due to indecision on the part of SAC's commander. Also, because of a top-down culture which had been originally established for nuclear war by General LeMay refused to listen to the suggestions of its aircrews. The LeMay culture had discouraged open and frank discussion to the point that only yes men made it to the top of the SAC organization where, potentially, they might have been able to proud the SAC commander into a change of tactics. (Surprisingly, NVA records and interviews with former SAM operators show exactly the opposite culture. Realistic discussion and innovation were encouraged among the batteries' commanders. )Ironically, although the NVA had run out of missiles by Day Four of the campaign, and the B-52s could have combed an undefended Hanoi, SAC was so rattled by its losses that it directed the B-52s to target outside Hanoi, thus giving the NVA time to reload. After that, B-52 losses mounted again. SAC commanders did their best to suppress revelation about their incompetence, even going so far as to suggest that one of their critics was mentally unstable. SAC has rewritten history in its official account of Linebacker II. His semi-fiction is still taught at the USAF's Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. It lacks NPOV or sources.",

Of anything, both should direct to Rock music (which Rock band was merged with). To I don't think this is controversial. Spyke You beat me to the punch. Clearly the term rock band is well used in the wiki and this needs to be discussed. I think moving as proposed would be too confusing since the distinction is Rock Band v rock band. Cab That's what {{for}} is for. Simply put {{for|the gene of music|Rock music}} or somesuch. Either way, Rock Band should not direct to Rock Band (video game). -·T·C·M Noting that a couple of thousand pages link to Rock band, and most of them refer to a group of people playing rock music, and not to a video game, I think we can't have Rock band directing to Rock Band (video game), as it now does. In the other hand, War fewer pages link to Rock Band, and a higher proportion of them refer to the video game. Thus, as far as internal linking is concerned, it makes sense to have Rock band as a direct to Rock music, and to move Rock Band (video game) to Rock Band, placing hatnotes on both articles. The alternative would be to have Rock band and Rock Band direct to Rock music, and leave Rock Band (video game) where it is, with a hatnote at Rock music. The only reason to go with the second option would be if we think people are likely to type Rock Band into the search box when they're thinking of bands playing rock music. One other thing - why are we discussing this here, instead of at the article talk page? - I've just copied the above from of:of, where it was listed in the incomplete proposals section. Consulting this talk page, a few sections up, it's clear that this page was just moved from Rock Band a little while ago, so before anybody decides to move it back, I thought I'd try to bring all the discussion to the same page. I would also direct the attention of anyone interested to Talk:Rock band, where I've left a comment about why that page really needs to say directed to Rock music, unless someone does something about the 2300 broken links first. -",

Even if his fairy tale is taken seriously it includes the admission that it was so windy on the day of his alledged hop that after he landed his plane was picked up by a gust of wind and slammed into some trees, so the idea that he flew without the aid of the wind is contradicted by his own story.

(begin)Unholy allianceAn unholy alliance is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups, especially if one is religious, for ad hoc or hidden gain. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the public interest. In early, well-known use of the term was by Theodore Roosevelt (TR):TAB To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day. - 1912 Progressive Party Platform, attributed to TRO'Whole, Patricia, The War of 1912, TIME in Partneship with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006.  and quoted again in his autobiographyRoosevelt, Theodore. In Autobiography: of. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, NEW YORK: MACMILLAN, 1913.  where he connect Trusts and monopolies (sugar interests, Standard Oil, etc. ) to Woodrow Wilson, Howard Taft, and consequently both major political parties. TAB After the breakup of Standard Oil, TR lost the election, and the unholy alliance he had identified, oligopolies of a few big commodities corporations and their political allies, continued otherwise undeserved by the mutually beneficial indifference of both major political parties. In 1935, retired Marine Major General Smedley Butler described how this unholy alliance influenced U. S.  foreign policy and how his job abroad had been to be a muscle man for big business. In 1944, conservative journalist John T.  Flynn described how this unholy alliance uses religion to sell its agenda abroad to the American public:TAB The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of largely, murder, ravine and barbarism. We are always moving forward with high mission, a destiny imposed by the Deity to regenerate our victims while incidentally capturing their markets, to civilise savage and senile and paranoid peoples while blundering accidentally into their oil wells. Flynn, John T.  (1944) Is We Go Marching. p.  240TAB A reference to this unholy alliance today is:TAB Unholy Alliance, a review by PBS journalist, Rev. Or. Allen Dwight Callahan ofTAB Phillips, Kevin (2006) American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century, Viking Press.

Unfortunately, this is not possible, or at least was a violation of industry regulations at the time. The proof is the history of TV's Adventures of Superman. The entire first season of 26 episodes (with Phyllis Coates instead of Noel Neill as Lois Lane) was in effect the pilot, being produced on speck and with no guarantee of getting on the air. To both promote the project and help defray costs if it did not sell, the producers began filling with a two-part episode, Unknown People, which they quickly released to theaters as a Saturday matinee feature, Superman and the Mole Men. Once a deal with Kellogg's got them an on-air committment, the producers discovered that they fell foul of a regulation that prohibited anything made for and released to theaters after 1948 from being shown on television. Consequently, Unknown People parts 1 & 2 were not televised until about 1960, when this rule was repealed and the series was released into general return indication. His same rule means that the subject of this article could—or at least should—not have been shown on television in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run. The other way around, maybe, but this has to be wrong. I know that neither linked-in article mentions this, and the one for the series even contradict it, but Film Fax magazine published a three-part article c. 2000 that went into great detail on the development and first season production, and reported this in no uncertain terms. Note also that List of Adventures of Superman episodes gives November 23, 1951 as the original airdate for both parts (the article on the feature gives this as the date of its theatrical opening), even though the series didn't get on the air until September 1952. IMDb does the exact same thing, while TV. com almost does, giving the date of both parts as December 18, 1951, and making minimal acknowledgment of the feature film version. When combined, the three essentially corroborate a lack of genuine original airdate (for the purposes of this discussion only, of course). To I repeat, Commando Cody would have been in violation of industry regulations had it played on TV in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run. Did Republic hoch Herbert Yates break the rules and get away with it, which if true is notable and should be pointed out, or does this article contain misinformation?",

Will contributory who watch this article please check that it is at Frederic Chopin (which seems to be the current consensus) before editing? Unfortunately protecting the page against moves won't stop cut-n-paste moves. I have asked OliverTwist to desist. ♬ ==Reply to Chopin fan and the rest== Chopin fan is right, who knows more about Chopin's other works, except of course for piano? The bottom line is, if on his birth certificate says Feb 22 that is legal, no matter what his family says, birth baptismal certificate, the bottom line is, so many so called justed wikipedians here are missing it all up, then when they admit they are wrong, they say they are only human, grow up will. —The preceding signed comment was added by • 22:17, February 9, 2006.  :The document in question is not a birth certificate, but a baptism certificate. His is not a government legal document, but a church document. The church is less interested in the date of birth of children than in the date on which they formally become members of the church, ie. their date of baptism. (That is why, for example, we know Beethoven's and Shakespeare's dates of baptism but not their dates of birth, and probably never will. ) :Nevertheless, most baptism certificates include a place for the child's date of birth to be written - which is good, because in many cases this is the only documentary record we have of the date. The certificate is filled out not by the parents, but by the priest, who was not a witness to the birth. He have to rely on the priest to record this date accurately, and he in turn has to rely on what the parents tell him. Chopin's baptism took place not just a day or two after his birth, but almost eight weeks later (23 April 1810). That is when the baptism certificate was written. Priests are humans and sometimes misunderstand what the parents tell them about the date of the child's birth. That is what the vast majority of Chopin scholars believe is what happened here. Of the mother and father always insisted Frederic was born on 1 March, and someone who wasn't there says something different, who are you going to believe? That is what this comes down to. Believing Chopin's parents, who were very much there - or believing the priest, who wasn't. ::Thank you: that was well stated. For these reasons, as well as for consistency with other publications (such as the New Grove), I suggest retaining only March 1 in the lead. I agree with Antandrus. ♬  :Recorded. Hired. ::Mouthed. ==I dont have much to say== You can do whatever you want, you can say whatever you want, I can say I was born on this day, if I go to social security and I want to change my name, I must show them my birthdate, i dont show what i think, period. therefore the ignorance of people lije JackofOZ or Makermi or whoever else is suggesting the date like this to remain, only shows your ignorance, therefore I am building a webster to let the world know not to bother with this cap and incorrect information here, enough said, date 2 22 is an option which is mandatory, you can argue as long as you want, use any words you like, you are deadly wrong and ignorant as usual. :For once, I'm in total agreement with you. You don't have much to say. West of luck with your webster. :Ay-yi-yi. There are so many things wrong with this argument that I don't even know where to begin. Indeed, it appears that I don't have much to say is the only truthful statement in this entire post. :#It's not a birth certificate. It's a baptism certificiate. The former is a legal document, the latter is not. :#The modern American use of legal documents has exactly nothing whatsoever to do with the early 19th century. :#Is everyone else participating in this argument has agreed, the other date is not even remote mandatory. :#Anyone can face a webpage. :#Anyone who seriously cl",

    "comment_text": "Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency. To Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia. I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today. The existing article is quite thorough on A and had almost nothing on B. A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology. Met's compare them: Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegiate collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration. Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data. Is far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet ), and I don't know anything about Maslow. Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong. I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic. Of course, I am striving for NPOV. To you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not? 21:55, 14 Rep 2003 (UTC)",
