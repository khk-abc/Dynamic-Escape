Of the person who wrote this is talking about the Summer Jam run by Jamn 94. 5, then that took place in Boston at the TD Banknorth Garden (formerly the FleetCenter) this past weekend. I am not going to make any edit, because I am not sure if this is referring to a different Summer Jam. I ask whoever wrote this to please clarify. It was the Not 97 Summer Jam. I cleared this up, and calcified that it was at Giant's Stadium in New Jersey. I also added a couple of details but didn't know how to link to a source (the source is   www. allhiphop. com hiphopnews ? of=446). As for cleaning up this page, you have to understand that for those of us who like ran it is difficult not to use terms like beef, called out, and other slang, because that's the vocab that is used to describe the events by those in them, and most of the people interested enough to write about them. However, since I do think myself capable of writing in proper english, I will attempt to clean this site up over this week. Words like beef and called out are not the problem. The problem is poor grammar, a generally undignified tone, and a lack of information and organization. The sentence I cited before Apparently signing rapier It to his own label ,The Black Wall Street Records, was the reason why Murder, Inc had a grudge against The Game. is, for example, still there. That do you expect, most the fan of this music are either stoned, retarded, or both. == The Response to 300 Bars from Rivals == (Added By of Stoney) The beef Is Furthering As The Game Has Released Two Mixtapes both by Black Wall Street DJ's J Skee and U Very Devil 1. U Now That It Is Volume. 3 And the latest one 2. Host-Unit Both depicting and kissing 50 Cent And His so-called G-Unit's (Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck And Olivia). The First Mixtape  U Now That It Is Volume 3 was released on 22nd of June 2005 consisting of 22 tracks fearing The Game and his members from Black Wall Street kissing G-Unit to the fullest. Some Examples Of Kisses are: saying that 50 Cent has used Steroids to build his body and his whole crew are not ganglia's. Olivia is depicted very badly as she is called a man with face breasts. The second Mixtape  Host Unit released on 31st August 2005 prior to Tony Yayo's Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon. Again this mixtape dishes G-Unit as being jokes stitches and waanabe gangstas. To far their hasnt been any strong replies from 50 Cent Except For 300 Shots which isnt really a good reply at all because this one has like 8-9 g unit members including the new Sign In's Cobb Deep, M. O. P and  Case trying to miss the enemies and making it a come-back to 300 Bars. Whereas The Game himself kissed g-unit in 300 Bars and the track being 18 Mins long. To far too me The Game Is winning this beef but who knows what still to come. (Added By Stoney) ==Is it Game or The Game? == I've heard both used by many people. Does anybody what it really should be? The Game is the official name, but on iTunes, recently they've been calling him Kris De Troch? I Think they call him Kris De Troch on iTunes because he does not want to be affiliated with aftermath and his name under the aftermath is The Game so he is using a different name. He is no longer called Kris De Troch on iTunes. ==Kanye Cracks Music on The Game== Stimulated Ltd.  has came to the conclusion of the missing verse Crack Music from the Late Registration from rapier producer Kanye West. Despite the verse being hot, The Game is still taking shots at 50 Cent, and Kanye West didn't want to bring that to the table. Although, trappers being is considerable of both The Game and 50 Cent, Kanye didn't want to be a part of it. He had interest in working with Eminem and Or. Dre. The Game is angry with Kanye and hopefully will release a miss directed to him and 50 Cent. == 300 Bars and Runnin songs == That is the name of all the songs used in 300 bars and the artist. == [Title] == But up. just to let all a'll know that this site will keep on being edited by m",

That Warren and Scott Brown were back to back Bostonian of the Year is interesting information in itself, and it could go into both BLPs, with the only reason for it not going into Brown's BLP is because it is not yet determined who his Democrat opponent is going to be.

To quote to make the target feel threatened or intimidated, and the outcome may be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to discourage them from editing entirely. - which is exactly how I feel. COI His is my statementWhen I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Cooling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a of company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tickling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said how would I like to be an associate of the company and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the of - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone's career d) Writing and searching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. Of that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edit of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Pulleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI. Liquid Nitrogen I am sorry, but I do not see your point in removing my edit. — Preceding signed comment added by (talk • contribs) COIwhatever you think best. I wouldn't mind, but this policy seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don't have some vested interests and or COI. One would have to suspend disbelieve to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it's one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Father than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. Anyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I'm sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit! Stange Behaviour By Editor McGeddonI am not sure how such a simple process of actually dating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange possession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with actual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. Of that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. His strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my surname when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL. I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge. He must hide behind his computer and live out his useless existence. Regards Thandi Moyo (nee Zambo)",

I think you are not grasping the point of an encyclopedia, which is okay - many editors on Wikipedia don't quite realize it because it's not innate evident. In encyclopedia (any encyclopedia, not just Wikipedia) serves to introduce readers to subjects in a way that accurately represents the reality of the subject matter. His means that, rather than being equally neutral to all sides, an article should be written from a neutral point of view that does not interfere with the weight of any points of view by representing them with undue weight (see the Undue Eight clause of of:NPOV). His means that on any given subject, if the majority of people accept A, and the minority of people accept B, then such should be reflected in articles on that subject. To if the standing consensus is that conspiracy theories are bank, while a significant minority accept conspiracy theories as reality, then it would be inaccurate to represent those 2 views as having equal weight, because one actually has more weight than the other - it would also be inaccurate to represent the minority view as the prevailing point of view, because in reality it isn't. I hope this explains it a little better. Usually this concept is a deal maker or deal breakers for wiki editors - many people can't tolerate the fact that Wikipedia administrators & editors won't allow them to give undue weight to their views, and in many cases this makes people leave Wikipedia with a sour taste in their mouths. That they would rather do is write a blow, a book, or in some forum where they can give their views equal or dominant weight.

Very established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article. Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as keep regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominated supported deletions, unless the article constituted a serious of:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity. Why? Simply put, the strength of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute. Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluation them. To, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweigh nearly all others. In administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here. His is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not. Father, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominated for the deletions of an article. Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletions to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasion; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletions of an article before meeting it (though the supporters of deletions may be distinctly in the minority). As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be delete. While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and nobility policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of nobility, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its nobility, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be delete. Father, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish nobility are likely to exist, the community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD. To, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletions on the grounds of inadequate pouring and failure to establish nobility, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion. Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion. Consequently, arguments of the form keep, I believe this subject is notable are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.",
